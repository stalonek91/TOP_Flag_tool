2024-01-16: Ilkka Vallinkoski: Started investigating. Verified with 24r1 and 24r2 ABIP that no REQ file is created for the BTS snapshots on IQ Data Analyzer therefore no IQ data is extracted.

2024-01-13 mdobija [5G Cplane] The analysis with attachments has been uploaded. From 5G Cplane pov, the reason of the issue is fail obtained on binding procedure (while creating endpoint for x2 communication) - visible in the logs from cp_sctp_X2 (ERR has been observed, exception is being thrown). The exception message is ""Error: Cannot assign requested address"". It means there is an issue related to binding procedure, especially related to thi ip address. Analysis of the actions related to this particular address has been performed, however the actions are similar in both passing and failing case. As most of the logs related to this ip address are from TRSW, we kindly ask TRSW team to continue analysis, and check if the ip address is for sure available/reachable, and the bind procedure should work on it.

-----------------------------
2024-01-15  ImanMasjedi [RFSW]: 
TF Meeting minutes: (they are stored also in the top of the chat ""03565854_Case_Notes"")
Issue summary: 
FID-10 triggered on AEHC radio (serial number is K9221601440) after SW upgrade to SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_000861_000030 from 23R3 GA load.  
Leo visited site 01/11 and found the AEHC is stuck without the login prompt. There was a console print dumped into the file. After that, he power cycled the radio and it is back to service now. There are start up prints that needs to be checked to confirm/exclude for possible memory corruption. DDR corruption is one of the option, but it was not confirmed yet.  
 
if the radio unit will boot up correctly, there will be the last reset course printed at the U boot printout. 
But because here we are failing, most likely we are failing at the very early stage. 
There is no print out with any indication 
 
Need confirmation on following queries: 
How many power reset were needed in order to restore the RU? In console logs there are two visible. Leo Gutin 
 
APs completed: 
 Check the log, check if Postmortem is correct -  hose postmortems will provide us no information 
 Collect snapshot and radio unit logs after power reset.

 3. Do we have correct PM log stored on the flash memory? - No. Lukasz Worsztynowicz  
 
 
Next steps: 
To investigate why power on reset recovered the radio and why radio didn't recover itself, and  the most important thing is to investigate why this recovery reset even not happened. 
To check how long we have collecting those console logs. Lukasz Worsztynowicz (Nokia)
To confirm when we are starting the kernel, the watchdog is enabled or not enabled for both BMU and Stratix. Grzegorz Huppert (Nokia)
If the issue will be visible again collect the new logs from the site - Leo Gutin 
Needed equipment for Chile Beamer (Stratix10) FPGA,  if you any questions or need help, contact Kaija Mustonen  kaija.mustonen@nokia.com & Antti-Jussi Karna  antti-jussi.karna@nokia.com 
LMI card, be used to connect Local PC and USB Blaster to RU(Chile FPGA inside). Check this with HW team (Antti-Jussi Karna  antti-jussi.karna@nokia.com),  
Short HDMI cable for connecting LMI to RU (Chile FPGA inside), One meeting HTML cable available  - 50cm preferred. 
USB Blaster 2 (Altera),  
Cable between USB Blaster and LMI See details: Connect Stratix Jtag debuger to LMI - RFSW - Dashboard (nokia.com) 
when you already have those status registers, you can push manually force this startup to proceed, get the logs from the console, maybe get the logs from RF software and then if the radio is still not operational you can power cycle. 
 
5.Reproduce the issue in the lab. check if Beijing Hangzhou team is impacted by maintenance break. Aleksander Pawlik (Nokia)
2024-01-12  ImanMasjedi [RFSW]: Issue resolved after power cycle of the radio. Analysis ongoing. Suspected DDR memory corruption. TF started.

[15-Jan-2024 Bill Tuel] This has not previously been a requirement so we don't know the thermal condition where they should match or how closely they should. Questions from thermal designer  - ""For this pronto, are we only comparing Zodiac ""RMOD"" temperatures to AHPMDB ""RMOD"" temperatures and the Zodiac ""RMOD"" temperatures need to be less than or equal to the AHPMDB ""RMOD"" temperatures? If so, at what thermal condition does the Zodiac ""RMOD"" temperature need to be less than or equal to the AHPMDB ""RMOD"" temperature. If not, what is the Zodiac ""RMOD"" temperature goal and what thermal condition corresponds to that ""RMOD"" temperature?"" LE for resolving this open topic is 19-Jan. It will then take 4 weeks of thermal verifcation testing.

[#TF Leader: N/A]
[#Summary: RLF is caused by not responded rrcReconfiguration where only 1 parameter is sent]
[#Next steps: check the logs from build with PR747347 correction to determine whether issue is still the same for occurring RLF calls]
2024-01-15 [CPlane]: retest with logs from the build with PR747347 correction was requested to see if the issue shares the same pattern as from before the correction. IR sent, LE: today
2024-01-15 JSandelin:With PR747347 correction SW (used SW is SBTS00_ENB_9999_240115_000004), following is seen:
- UE amount is going into 4500 again
- ""Rrc Reconfiguration procedure failed"" is still flooding
5G KPIs:
NR_5030a/5G SgNB triggered normal release ratio = 100%
NR_5013a 5G Contention based RACH setup success ratio = 100%
NR_5167a/5G SA RRC connection establishment success ratio = 100%
NR_5166a/5G RRC reconfiguration success ratio = 92%
So most of KPI issue were coming actually from PR747347.
We can take out TOP from this PR and focus on ""NR_5166a/5G RRC reconfiguration success ratio"" & ""Rrc Reconfiguration procedure failed"" with this Pronto. I can also change PR title if its needed.
2024-01-15 [CPlane]: rrcReconfiguration parameters are the same in OK and NOK builds, binary search is ongoing, however between OK and NOK builds there are no changes in procedures taking place in the scenario (at least for now). L2-PS team will be asked to check further why UE doesn't respond to rrcReconfiguration
2024-01-13 AnuJ IR (binary search) under testing in PET, LE for results 15.01.
2024-01-12 [CPlane]: RLF is caused by not responded rrcReconfiguration, which contains only one parameter. As test scenario was working before, we need to check and compare OK and NOK logs to determine whether mentioned reconfiguration occurs also in OK logs and if yes, we will need to narrow down the release on which the issue started to occur to choose potential changes in software which could cause the issue. IR sent
2024-01-12 [CPlane]: requested logs were delivered, checking the reason of rrcReconfiguration failure and RLF in mentioned failing calls
2024-01-11 [CPlane]: EMIL logs and PM files are needed to further check the reason of 5G calls failure, IR sent
2024-01-11 [CPlane]: investigation started, checking the logs to determine timeout cause, will share more information when there is some conclusion

2024-01-15: Idriss Cheurfa: Awaiting CuDo update proposal. LE 16/01 for the update.
2024-01-11 [cplane] arkula: After checking requirements preconditions of the test are invalid. According to the wording of 5G_CP_ARC_ALG_13417 we should filter out scell candidate which does not support all the slices OF PCELL. Tester has found out that preliminary email thread mentions of UE's slices, not PCELL'S sclices. Question raised to the SFS. Awaiting response if we should switch to UE's slices (change requirements) and follow with this PR or leave as it is now.
2024-01-12 [cplane] arkula: after answer from SFS and crosschecking requirements again cplane works as intended. In my opinion pronto should be CNNed. Tester wants to change implementation and add improvements to the scell filtering algorithm under PR instead of requesting new CNI. PR test scenario is invalid according to the current gnb desing. Discussion with tester is ongoing.

2024-01-15 S Lanneau L1 is working on IQ Data decoder issue recovery. No LE yet when the decoder issue will be solved. New TFL Miika Rajala.
2024-01-15: Xianming Song Transfer to L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_ESP Assign to ESP SemiStatic Team: @Miika Rajala From [Support] task to Own this PR. UL_PHY Continue analysis from UL_PHY point of view.

Signal level seem to go up and down fluctuate with sudden CRC Nok. Routing to L1 UL PHY as agreed in TF meeting with Miika Rajala. 
2024-01-12 F. Djebbari (L2-PS)
No errors in L2-PS could be identified that could explain the issue.
[Next Step] L1 ULphy expert should take over the analysis and further characterize the suspected UL radio signals coming from RF
2024-01-10 F. Djebbari [L2-PS]: 
So far no errors in L2-PS could be identified that could explain the issue.

[Next Step]
•	L2-PS: provide analysis of UEs with high BLER
•	L1 ULphy : check if there are any reason why the two channels (PUSCH and PUCCH) conditions and the reason of instability (for instance no issue in PUSCH and PUCCH lonks between RF, channel are up and running , IQ, ...). IR raised
•	CP-UE: check if there are missing neighboring relationships that prevent UE from performing a HO, thus increasing the BLER.

2024-01-15 Donghao: the Knife in which only the rule to accept packets to DHCPv6 server failed the test. From log we found packets from DHCPv6 server are dropped. IR open for a new knife in which both two rules are added.
Today will discuss solution in CB006533(CB006533 eCPRI Transport with M plane over IPv6) meeting.
2024-01-13 donghao: two rules added(one is multicast address for DHCPv6 server and the other is a local address) to nftables and it works. this can be a WA solution. TRS experts are involved to discuss if we need really need add the multicast address and how about the local address.
An IR is sent to verify a knife in which the multicast address is added in code.
2024-01-12 donghao:  no explicit accept rule in nftables for DHCPv6 packets which will be dropped by default filter rules.

[#Summary: We have clocking problem when MARS does SW upgrade with SW reset procedure. The ethernet drivers are stopping link specific clocks and in this SW reset case somehow the clock driver sees that clocks are already disabled (we see this reset loop, when going from 23R4 to 24R1 with SWreset / we do not see reset loop, when booting 24R1 with PoR)]
[#Next steps: ]
2024-01-13 AnuJ/PET No WE Support from PET as 24R1 2.0PD 120h stabi run ongoing with testline
2024-01-12: KKj: SoC SW analysis now prepared (see attached). As a next step to continue the investigation in RF side (OSBOOT), and also to confirm whether the RC could be the same as in PR746824/PR746953 cases.
2024-01-11: KKj: The LMI logs seems to miss most of kernel log prints, thus the debug level should be enabled to kernel logs (knife or R&D flag modification?). At this point of the investigation, SoC SW experts think that EthSS is not the root cause of reset loop.
2024-01-11: KKj: Case transferred to SoC SW team, due to kernel warning that comes because one of ethernet clocks is disabled twice (the double disabling of clocks is not a fatal issue). SoC SW experts will continue checking of the latest logs and RF Coco team needs to be involved to do the same (Primarily console/LMI logs, as the problem is not visible in runtime/PM logs).

if BBU want to mute the stream, only need set the beamid bigger than 8192.

TAS can invoke setupentries with right values and option 61 and check further to ensure RU is getting the address.

Tentative Correction is already made in the code and published.
Waiting for vDU package with DHCP container v4.20.0 and rcp_ccs_vdu v120.0.0. 
Once the package is available -- we can verify and see if the issue gets resolved.

This pronto is a spinoff for setupentries with switch-network.

2024-01-12 Arvo Heinonen: Waiting for TRSOAM alarm implementation. Currently some issue in PIT testing needs to be resolved.
2024-01-11 Arvo Heinonen: It was agreed to fix this PR by waiting for new alarm implementation from TRSOAM (LE 2024-01-10) to be published. And then publish certificate management container version 3.Y.X. This should resolve the PR by taking a completely new implementation of certificate management into use.
2024-01-09 Arvo Heinonen: Based on log analysis everything seems to be working on RCP Certificate Management side as expected. Need TAS experts to check why failed CRL Download does not trigger CRL Fault.
2024-01-09 Arvo Heinonen: Need to check with tester what is the expectation in the failed test. From test description looks like in the test an alarm is expected when no CRL DPs matching the CRL DP source are configured. However, this assumption might not be correct.

- RRU is checking the power gap issue between antennas which is main issue.
- Seems IQ data collected has problem, is double checking with tool team about IQ data collection issue.
2024-01-12 Wang Guangyao:
- IQ data provided, 5gmax is passed for all IQ data, but 3 antennas have power in bip logs which not matched with 2RX configuration. Will check further about the logs.

2024-01-15 [Zhao Rain/Zhang Peng] Will have an sync meeting this afternoon with L1 expert and Local support.
2024-01-12 [Zhao Rain/Zhang Peng] From the new set of logs, in emil log, there are 143 RACH records which have impact on KPI NR_5167C. We could find 10 records in TTITRACE. For these 10 records:
(1) 6 records for MSG4's harq ACK with a very low SINR and 4 records for MSG4 failure with 5 times transmission.
(2) from the statistic for ALL msg4's transmission. The average SINR for MSG4's pucch(NON_DTX) is 10.5. 
Maybe we need involve L1 experts to comment further.
[2024-01-11][Zhao Rain]: wait for new log set to analyze more samples.
[2024-01-10][Zhao Rain]: KPI file provide. The cells with issue have higher noise than others. This could be the reason of low RRC reestablishment success ratio. 
[2024-01-09][Zhang Peng] We are suspecting this case is caused by a UE issue. MSG5 DTXed on UE side. We Suspect MSG4 is not received in UE side. 
We are still checking RRC reestablishment.  We also asked CIS team to capture UE log, but currently it is saying that it is hard to capture UE log.

[#TF Leader: Isabelle Jolly]
[#Summary:  UL latency issue is seen when  BBPooling features (CB008940/CB010513/CB011028) are activated. The test is a baseline system test (Traffic on 1 UE and 1 cell TDD FR1).This issue is occasional, it happens 1/3 runs ]
[#Next steps: Investigate the scheduling holes  in KO case, and understand why the UE is sometimes granted with 13 PRBs whereas ul pro active scheduling is activated and should not exceed default value (3 PRBs)]
2023-01-15 Gilles Bramoulle L2PS : Still focus investigation on the scheduling part to understand why so many SR in the KO case. Found that ul proactive scheduling does not grant as it should, there are scheduling holes in KO case. That’s why there are so many SR sent by the UE. 
In OK case, we need to understand why sometimes 13 PRBs are granted whereas ul proactive scheduling is activated and the scheduling should not exceed 3 PRBs. TTis doc analysis in attachement 
Next step: Investigate the scheduling holes  in KO case, and understand why the UE is sometimes granted with 13 PRBs whereas ul pro active scheduling is activated and should not exceed default value (3 PRBs).
2023-01-12 Gilles Bramoulle L2PS : analysis done on timestamp linked to the doc in attachement,(PR746382_CompUPAnalyserOkNok 1.docx) . Sinr and radio conditions does not explain that the values for MCS and PRB are slightly differents between the two case.Next step: We will focus on the scheduling process specially on the repartition of the scheduling per sfn  and on the scheduling Request, we noticed 1886 SR in KO case, and 2 in OK case.
2023-01-11 Gilles Bramoulle L2PS : Analysis based on TTis for Ok/NOK cases shows no obvious degradation or Cqi, sinr , rssi, noisePower, rxPower, MCS, numOfPrb. No radio degradation confirmed. See attached doc (PR746382_CompTtiOkNok 3 1.docx)
Meeting with tester done, explanation of the scenario (UDP packets of 255 bits sent to server (one way), No UE mobility) and explain latency measurement (see Mom in team) . No news from OAM to explain inconsistency of BBpooling params). Next step: Bip, syslog analysis to check difference of scheduling in case OK/NOK. Focus analysis on exact timestamps while latency exceeded over the target in the failed case.
2023-01-10 Gilles Bramoulle L2PS: Analysis of BBPool configuration which is correct. However, there is a mismatch between NIDD configuration and parameters received by CPRT. In logs analysis, we observed a sinr variation during the test,but no obvious issue on MCS and slot scheduling on log KO. 
Next step: Continue analysis on logs ok and ko. Add OAM in investigation in order to explain the mismatch between NIDD configuration and cprt received parameters. Planned a meeting with tester to explain the complete test driving scenario and condition between runs.
2023-01-09 Gilles Bramoulle L2PS After clarification with tester, the test is a baseline system test (Traffic on 1 UE and 1 cell TDD FR1), feature 8124 URLLC is not activated.
The UL latency issue is seen only when  BBPooling features (CB008940/CB010513/CB011028) are activated . 
Pdcch/paging configurations checked corrects
Next steps: check subpool configuration , check why MCS decreased in case NOK whereas good radio conditions, check why the scheduling is done on slots 4 and 14 for OK case and on slots 9 and 19 for NOK case

2) LFS needs to provide a plan to add XEONs last reset reason in the logs of xstart and ystart instead of that not supported register (and/or clarify what is logged)
3) MCU HW API needs to provide logging the future last reset reason registers in bmu reg dump files
2024-01-11 E.BOUET - FPGA comments were provided : I'm am sorry I could not find any BMU debug trace aka DDT for that time 2024-01-05T22:44:48. I could only find some traces for earlier time or later time in various logs and last resets logs. Side finding in these logs: ABIL boot loader does not display FPGA LAST_RESET_EVENT register @ 0x09.
There is not N/A PWRSEQ_STAT register.
How can we know the cause of ABIL XEONs reset w/o that register? LFS must provide logging improvement! Waiting for LFS comments.

2024-01-11 tvu: IR test needs to be postponed due to TOP blocker issue PR746626. This PR IR work hopefully can continue by saturday 13.1.2024.
2024-01-10 tvu: IR test about to start. LE for result is latest on friday 12.1.2024 as hung UE first time detected after 43h.
2024-01-10 makielty: IR330988 raised, EMIL logs needed due to insufficient syslogs for hanging UE, without EMIL it's hard to narrow down RC further. Meanwhile trying to reproduce case in SCT.

2024-01-09 makielty: hanging UE scenario identified:
1. RrcResumeRequest1
2. on CP-UE, during handling E1:dlDataNotification there's incoming event drxConfigProcedure (queue dlDataNotification for later)
3. L2-HI sends BearerInactivityInd (logs are cut off, probably UE is not moved to Inactive state)
4. CP-UE resumes queued dlDataNotification (RRC Inactive-Connected transition procedure is cut off)
Syslog doesn't contain CpCell_ResourceReleaseReq for [""cuUeId"": 122757].
The problem can be related with handling of such msgs order.
Maybe CNI-96899 would handle/improve that.

2024-01-15 CPLANE: it turns out that A5 triggered ping-pong Handovers are happening all the time with such A5 configuration and those handovers alone are not causing PDCP delay problems.

#AaSysCom cannot allocate memory - OutOfMemory
2024-01-15 Sylvain Cuisset [L2PS]: Binary search launched and IR raised to retrieve the first load introducing issues. In syslogs, first UserStop in timeout in CP_RT studied. No log in L2PS seen for this first UserStop. Analysis to be extended to other messages in timeout.
2024-01-15 Veikka Mikkola[PET]: LE for IR331686 16.1
2024-01-12: S. Cuisset: Some messages from CP-RT to L2-PS (UserSetup, UserStop, UserDelete,..) are filling the queues. Syslogs around the first crash under analysing and compared with syslogs coming from OK load. New IR raised to try to reproduce the crash more earlier.
2024-01-11: P.Exbrayat: anaylsis on-going to undesrtand if Out of memory on  AaSysCom is related to message sent from CP-RT  to L2-PS
10.01 [SFC ABIP] : Investigation is ongoing , no finding yet.

2024-01-15 TomaszB: LE for answering IR330871 is 01/19 due to maintenance break in Dallas and other requests in parallel - also concerns regardingrobustness of the system: 
why nothing is reported against SFP/link before reset (while the connection is ok although problem with SFP is visible)
why the 1st try to sync is with the malfunctioning SFP
why there is no info about SFP/link malfunction when the sync is moved to another link after additional reset?

2024-01-09 TomaszB: LE for answering IR330871 is 01/12. The SFP does not show any mulfunction now and all data is available, I have also replugged it in the radio and reconnected optlink. It happend one time only so far. So maybe the system should be more robust to handle such case where the SFP is potential issue especially that it was onetime issiue and SFP does not seem to be broken now.
2024-01-09 KrzysztofKiser: [RFSW] In logs we can see that one of the SFP is not reporting any data and on this port radio has problems with sync. We suspect SFP issue to be the case here. IR is raised to replace OPTIF2 SFP and verify if problem reappears.

AIF2 to check why the segments are not reaching radio. If no issues seen, the next team to check will be murkku, followed by radio. Please refer the GSM DSP analysis attached.
2023-01-09 NMucharska [RFSW] Draco analysed this case and for now, doesn't see any issue on their side. We need to check it deeper. Also we need GSM BB support because we are waiting 2s for GSM stabilization, then we have irq and alarm and from radio pov it is correct and this can be problem with GSM.

2023-01-08 Guoliang Zhou[RFSW]: From the test result of yesterday's debug knife, the time slot of interrupt is random, even happened when capturing snapshot. Have to ask Michal Marszalek who is PR700947 code change owner of https://gerrite1.ext.net.nokia.com/c/RFSW/INTERNAL/draco/+/1605914 to investigate this further. Add him to PR chat.
2023-01-07 Guoliang Zhou[RFSW]: With team expert: Chen Bruce's investigation and test team's debug knife's verification, the issue is confirmed by the code change of PR700947 in RF.FRM5.trunk.20240104.015. Now try to prepare new knife to disable report 1102 alarm (the interrupt monitor does not stop, yesterday knife revert the commit which also disable the interrupt), so it will not trigger 1905 reset the RRU. Because from RRU reset logs, the interrupt is generated after carrier active 4 seconds. From alarm spec, it considers that after carrier active 2 seconds later, the carrier become stabilized, in this knife we need to confirm the interrupt will last how long timer. If the interrupt continued generated, the carrier maybe has really problem. Now debug knife is under testing.

The shown behaviour is also according to 3GPP TS 38.331 Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol specification
chapter 5.5.4 Measurement report triggering (search for reportAmount).


2024-01-12 Hermann Danne
I analysed the latest logs (Selvamariappan Subramanian)

reportAmount value is set to 2. This corresponds to r4.
 
Four measurement reports are sent by the UE (as configured) and CP-UE performs four failing HO attempts (because maxNumOfGBRBearersSA is
zero in the target cell). No further HO attempts afterwards as long as the there are no new trigger conditions for further measurement reports.
 This is expected behaviour. We should set this pronto to CNN.

Requirement for reportAmount: 5G_CP_IF_RRC_4489

\\eseefsn50.emea.nsn-net.net\rotta4internal\HetRAN_2\selva\maxnumofgbrbearersSA\New_logs_4

blockHOtimer is not set in both BTS.

I just found one RLF in the new logs. That is quite strange compared to the older logs.
 
I could ask a specification expert. Here are the requirements:
 
5G_L3_FLOW_2043: NGAP Ho Preparation Failure.
5G_L3_FLOW_20430 and 5G_L3_FLOW_83835: Blacklisting NG HO (I saw no blacklisting in the logs).
 
When the UE is configured for measurements, it gets for each measurement type the values ""reportAmount"" and ""reportInterval"" (defined in nidd).
 
When the trigger condition is not left and the Ue is not reconfigured concerning measurements, it will send only reportAmount number of measurements. After that, no more measurements are sent.

2024-01-11: Hermann Danne:
I now checked for ueIdCu:0, New_Logs_3/Source_Snapshot_MRBTS-1008_1008_SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_240102_000005_20240109-0126

ueidCu:0 gets 7 times an NGAP:HandoverPreparationFailure, when it tries the 8th time, there is an RLF,  tNgRelocOverallTimeout and subsequent release. 
[Yesterday 13:54] Hermann Danne (Nokia)
Similiar for ueIdCu:16384 in ./BTS1008_123D_part_1/BTS1008_1734_pm_2_syslog/runtime_cp_ue.LOG:
 
4 times Received NGAP:HandoverPreparationFailure, after the last one, it tries a 5th time and
we again get an RLF with subsequent release.
 
 

2024-0-10 SigiG: Additional testing request send to get logs on source side to see details on source side when all HO request against Target gNB fails (as expected as maxNumOfGBRBearersSA to 0 in target cell is set). e.g. To see what happens after the last HO attempt, whether there is an RLF
or an target cell black-listing.
2024-01-10 SigiG: For a stable call seems after several HO failures to target cell due to  maxNumOfGBRBearersSA to 0 , after chnaging back this maxNumOfGBRBearersSA to 10, there is no more HO request triggered to target cell ...
2024-01-09 HermD:
Analysis with new Logs (cp_cl and cp_ue debug enabled):
\\eseefsn50.emea.nsn-net.net\rotta4internal\HetRAN_2\selva\maxnumofgbrbearersSA\New_Logs_3 shows correct behaviour:
After maxNumOfGBRBearersSA is reset from 0 to 10 and blockHoTimer is expired, CP Cell Admission Resp for NGHO is ok again. Behaviour is as expected.

[#Summary: 
summarize status:
-- we see this as an failure during jesd serdes firmware download
-- Jesd Serdes has 16 serdes block, this occurs randomly in any of those serdes, always only one Serdes fails
-- very difficult reproduce, typically occurs in SW reset use case
-- we have tried to reproduce on SoC board over last weekend without success may require whole radio/BTS setup when occurs
-- Broadcom has analyzed shared logs and they assume Serdes internal processor has crashed
-- Broadcom has commented that one possibility is glitch in reference clock that crashes internal processor, because this is very difficult reproduce debugging is very difficult
-- Mars SoC may have reference clock glitch in SW reset ]
[#Next steps: Test with latest rel-23R4-MARS_V77.3.0.25, if not solved then HW reset will be a solution temporarily]

To answer why CS1 list is lower a knife will be needed to enable higher amount of UEs to be traced in TTI Traces.

Can you to reproduce the issue using only WebEM? So instead of starting BIP log collection with gnb_logs and L2PS component trace with DCAP just use WebEM.
A: [GNB_Logs, V2.62.2] Released on 2023.11.29  Nokia Internal Use Only.
- I can try tomorrow to reproduce issue using WebEM. 
- Can you test with [GNB_Logs, V2.63 ] 2023.12.24  Nokia Internal Use Only. 
Next: IR-1 created and waiting for IR-1 response

2024-01-15: Ajay Sangwan (Nokia): Issue reproduced again on latest SW: SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_240112_000006, New Logs collected.
Uula Ollila (Nokia) NEW Analysis on going: I would also assume that there would be some kind of L1 logs in the snapshots freezed after the ABIP is up again after recovery. But no, there is nothing useful. I think there is two options for that. 1. The L1 does not have any crash that would trigger log collection. 2. When the connection is lost to the ABIP unit, the unit loses power or something similar so that logs cannot be collected.
Do I understand correctly that the RAD parameter update cannot then be the reason for the observed failure? Do you know which action then triggers this? BIP log collection? 

2024-01-12: Uula Ollila (Nokia)  analysis on going: 
- No traces that L1 is crashing in any logs. But there is normal startup logs available so reset is done, but I would say L1 is not causing that.
-We should go trough the logs from other modules (L2,OAM and so on) to see where this Pronto should be transferred.
- That states in my opinion that the problem is due to Fault ID 4341 EFaultId_FspSubunitLostAl.
Description: Indicates that an FSP sub-unit is unavailable (lost).
Proposal: First contact in case of the problem is BOAM_CA_BASEBAND

2024-01-11 Doris：L3 update
the root cause of re-conect SCTP needs 4 minutes is GNB as cleint and shutdown SCTP by server, the client neet to wait  sctpWaitTimeInitSeqRetry times then reconnect. the default value of sctpWaitTimeInitSeqRetry is 240s =4minutes.
NEXT STEPS: PR seems can CNNed or transfer to SPEC.
SUPPORT NEEDED:no

2024-01-10 Doris：L3 update
STATUS: discuss with spec and PR author. Today I ask arch, 4 minutes to shutdown to re-connect SCTP is not normal.
NEXT STEPS: Continue to discuss and I will continue to check why SCTP reconnect needs 4 minutes.
SUPPORT NEEDED:no

2024-01-09 Doris：L3 update
STATUS:PR author has confirmed Xn link can be recovered after retry times to maxNumXnSetupRetry. It needs 25 minutes to recovery. He think it is too much. I add Liang 2. Gao to discussed it. 
NEXT STEPS: Discussed the time of Xn link recovery.
SUPPORT NEEDED:no

2024-01-08 Doris：L3 update
STATUS: I have explained why the Xn link cannot be recovered and said it is not an normal case, PR author is agreed with the reason. but need to confirm the xn link can be recovered after retry times to maxNumXnSetupRetry 
NEXT STEPS: wait PR author on line, and check if the xn link can be recovered after the retry times to maxNumXnSetupRetry.
SUPPORT NEEDED:no

2024-01-05 Doris：L3 update
STATUS: Discuss with Liang 2. Gao , he think it is a noraml case, because two Xn setup request sent almost at the same time, this is a very extreme situation. after retry maxNumXnSetupRetry  times, the sctp will shutdown then connect again, then Xn link can setup.
NEXT STEPS: wait PR author on line, then discuss about this case.
SUPPORT NEEDED:no

2024-01-04 Doris：L3 update
STATUS: The cause of why the Xn link is not recovered is found,please see the attach file 0104_analysis_cplane_cn1.docx.  but I don't know if it is an issue, I need to ask releated arch to confirm it.

2024-01-11 [DCS] Aleksandra Zawierucha: RC found. Correction in DCS is needed. Testing probable solution
2024-01-10 [DCS] Aleksandra Zawierucha: DCS throws exception due to the fact that when failed cable is removed only its mo object CABLNK_L is deleted, CABLIN_R and CABLINK_A are still visible. Because of that DCS allows to try allocate cell NR-11 on ABIO even if connection doesn't exist. I need to find out why they are removed so late and how DCS should behave.

2024-01-10 Mtomala:Sanna Tikkanen cannot investigate further. The problem is that Loner is not responding to BCN requests, and that is the reason why Node synchronization on XEON cannot be done. Loner is the only source for BCN we have on ABIL.Open question in the chat pending.

2024-01-12 [FM] sosdian: FM analysis uploaded. TA pointing back to TRS team, so transferring pronto.
2024-01-12 [FM] sosdian: questions on chat still not answered, will soon (today) upload an analysis from FM perspective. In TRS analysis the logs are in wrong order, such that the last message that requests a raise of fault is actually coming before the message that requests the cancellation (if we look at time stamps). If this is the case, then the fault is not showing because it was cancelled and this is not an FM issue. Need more time to be sure and need answers on the GC to understand the expected behavior of the TC. 
2024-01-11 [FM] sosdian: after checking logs a few more questions regarding the expectations for this TC were asked. Is the fault expected at any point of the TC, or at the end? Does it show in WebEM at any point, or not at all? Waiting for response and continuing investigation.
2024-01-10 [FM] sosdian: FM started investigating this issue. Found multiple logs with different situations. Will update tomorrow after checking all logs available.

1. We make retry writing sysrepo if error reason is DS lock (DU 's  lock msg), the duration is 60s. this solution can fix this PR .    but we found another issue  :  when new account start to work , it will cause closing old seesion(old account) fail .    and we have tried test without 60s  retry writing , closing old session fail is still there.
 2. how to find the closing old session issue ?  ---- According to analysis the IR331183's log and the older(\\nescrotta.nesc.nokia.net\rotta\MN_RAN\RAN_ST\24R3\New_Features\RAN_PZ_BLR\RAN_PZ_BLR_SG01\Fault_id_4645_Additional_Netconf_account_creation_failure\261223) log ,   knife is same (rfsw-package-fru6_0x26D6CCE8.tar, there is no our solution fix in this knife and just add debug log.)    However, the results of the two tests are different. The former shows a drop when close old session, while the latter closes the session successfully.
3. We speculate that this is an occasional issue (close old session), create new IR331589 to varify it and according to the reply to decide whether to create a new PR for the closing old session issue.

2024-01-12 saihuaz [RFSW] IR331183's reply is not expected, radio is nt getting detected, DHCP issue，knife should be retested.
2024-01-11 Fanyong [RFSW] Netconf support requested and available - 3 questions checked and responded by Netconf for ""remote channel is closed"" - Clarified that due to ""close session"" is owing to ""ERR SSH channel unexpected EOF"", DU didn't send close-session after timeout, instead, DU will disconnect the old ssh link and netconf will proceed w/ re-connection; Furthermore, timeout value of DU is hardcoded in libnetconf2 w/ 200ms - Discussion is Ongoing
2024-01-10 saihuaz [RFSW] foam requested two questions to BOAM expert, waiting for their reply by BTS log.
2024-01-09 saihuaz [RFSW] IR330419 has responded, wait for BOAM expert to analysis BTS log.

2024-01-04 saihuaz [RFSW] new account created new session, but old session was closed failed due to ""termination reason: dropped"" , so WatchdogTimer of old session from foam is not stopped, after create new session, there is no Watchdog reset rpc msg from DU to old session , so WatchdogTimer of old session is expired!

2024-01-12/11 : Feedback from AMI received ( they asked to reproduce with a debug flag ). Debug knife will be generated but the problem isn't reproduced at the moment in our PS_REL lab ( 4 setup running in // for reproduction). Tester will try to reproduce also this friday( 12Jan) . 
2024-01-10/11  : internal meeting held . Action were posted to the chat . We have contacted AMI (3rd party provider) for support on this issue . In // , we tryied to reproduce internally .At the moment , we need AMI feedback to provide a debug Knife . LE : Friday (12 Janv)

2024-01-04 Mtomala:Seems the issue is caused by the fact that BM enables spoofing for port which does not have actual GNSS device connected to it.Because of that the request for enabling is waiting 36 seconds hanging on ddal_gnss_device_try_detect and additional 6 seconds on two executions of ddal_gnss_set_port_power_line_state. This total 42 seconds is to much for 30 second timeout in BM.
 It looks like HWAPI should immediately respond to enabling request not wait till device is ready to handle commandsDariusz Mocek requested to share the R&D info in pronto toll with the LE for the next action before 8:45CET.
2024-01-03 [McuHwapi] DaviauCyril: GC opened, C&S topic.
2024-01-02: V-M Laaksolinna: Looks like fault 1806 was raised due to late response from MCUHWAPI GNSS service to BM.
2024-01-02: Mika Kempas: New case, tester analysis does not point anyhow to UP HWAPI

[#Next steps: to have WA first and find the RC.
Improvements/WAs that are planned for 23R4 1.1MP delivery:
- runtime partition mounting fix 03538050
- RSSI-SINR improvement under ticket 03559776 (porting from PR740380)
- UO&M fix for storing exclusion node file (under this/03544639 pronto)
- autodetection of nodes with DDR initialization issue and adding them to exclusion list (under this pronto)]

2024-01-15 Fanyong [RFSW] *Blocked* by 23R4 CF Verification - Wait for outcome & Wait for new Decision - Started from this weekend, Vivek 2. Srivastava raised concerns that such WA needs to be manually handed is Unneeded for Customer after CF had created at Jan. 9 then Author Amit Joshi may NOT verify CF; But how about next step? They need decision-makers to make comments ...
2024-01-13 Fanyong [RFSW] 1/ 23R4 CF RFT-ed - As aligned with Author, official NodeB Load can be installed and then the 1st WA of UOAM can be deployed *manually* as Verification - Wait for outcome; 2/ Today one concern raised that the expected WA should be the one which should be deployed automatically - I do not know whether there was something changed as No any such voice out from Teams or TF meeting minutes; But, the 2nd WA of HZ Base is underway, details can be checked with Lixiao Ji
2024-01-12 Fanyong [RFSW] *WA* CF - ""SBTS23R4 SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_001065_000000_WA"" was officially RFT-ed && Notification sent out to Author to ask for Verification w/ Priority ... Wait for Verification Outcome
2024-01-12 Fanyong [RFSW] 1/ I was reminded that according to FM Process - https://nokia.sharepoint.com/sites/mn-fault-management/SitePages/Corrections.aspx#setting-correction-as-%E2%80%9Cready-for-testing%E2%80%9D-rft-%28correction-known%29, 23R4 CF can be set as ""RFT"" - DONE; 2/ Good News - Notification from CTA6 CI Lead that Blocker PR was identified as Noise owing to Env issue - New 3-Star Load released - RF.CTA6.23R4.20240109.002
2024-01-12 Fanyong [RFSW] 1/ It's an active manner that alignment reached out that once CFs closed, PR can be transferred out though there is far away from our expectation; 2/ Weekend OT Requested and it was highlighted in Teams to let PM and TF help - New proposal given to let PR be firstly transferred to Base as new WA is Ongoing, then once 2nd WA DONE by Base Team, PR will be back to SOC ... Base team's feedback is that owing to not sure ""WA works as expected"", so suggests to hold on PR transition - I'd like to do not make any comments here but wait for PM and TF's decision; 3/ Blocker PR744976 labelled w/ TOP1 but progress is NOT so good - Discussion/Actions between L1Low and Draco is Ongoing
2024-01-11 Fanyong [RFSW] PR Ping-Pong as *Agreement* broken - After UOAM Delivery Activity on WA completed, No appropriate GIC decided by TF for several days though No any Actions to UOAM && Agreement disagreed as well. Interface Tribe FM was involved yesterday evening for help - by the way, the proposal to separate GIC discussion from TF should be helpless, as such decision cannot be made w/o technical background. The more serious thing is - even all CFs with WA being closed, there might be No appropriate GIC proposed just because ""it is difficult"".
2024-01-10 Fanyong [RFSW] CTA6 23R4 Load release is blocking by PR744976
2024-01-10 Fanyong [RFSW] UOAM *WA* - 23R4 Load Release being Blocked, 24R1/Trunk CF Ready for Next Step
2024-01-09 Fanyong [RFSW] 1/ UOAM *WA* - Only 3-Star Trunk Load released - RF.CTA6.trunk.20240106.004 & being integrated to SBTS00_ENB_9999_240108_000013 (1st Load); Keep waiting for 23R4 / 24R1 3-Star Load Release; 2/ 23R4 Load Release info - CTA6 CI Lead told us 23R4 Load Release found new issue w/ symptom ""radio startup fail"" but soon commented it might be introduced by #568 which only contains Bugfix of PR728041 delivered by PL UOAM; 3/ Root cause track - Refer to Meeting Minutes (https://nokia.sharepoint.com/sites/madesoc/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fmadesoc%2FSiteAssets%2FTeam%20Site%20Notebook&wd=target%28PMT%2FPronto%20and%20Bug.one%7CC6ED5333-2FB9-4E51-B999-E60340841DB2%2FOccasional%20DDR%20init%20failures%20with%20MADE2%20based%20products%7CE468BA9D-11EB-46E6-BCBC-1ECC1296542E%2F%29)
2024-01-08 Fanyong [RFSW] 1/ *WA* in UOAM - Delivery completed, 2 tickets to CAT6 CI Lead added in had been raised and to UOAM, just wait for Official Load Release, No other Actions; 2/ *Root Cause* - Actions listed in https://jiradc.ext.net.nokia.com/secure/attachment/2916621/TF_Meeting_Minutes_20240105.jpg, to be checked w/ new TF sync meeting (Not launched yet, up to TF Leader: ⁠Lauri Matilainen)
2024-01-06 Fanyong [RFSW] Brief summary for *WA* Deliveries thru https://gerrite1.ext.net.nokia.com/q/03544639 -
1/ 23R4 - Merged to 23R4 #569 as RF.CTA6.23R4.20240105.001 & Ticket ""#1214 - CTA6 - 23R4"" raised to request 23R4 Load Release;
2/ 24R1 - Merged to #188 as RF.CTA6.24R1.20240105.002 & Ticket raised ""#1215 - CTA6 - 24R1""
3/ Trunk - Merged to #8040 as RF.CTA6.trunk.20240106.003;
4/ ""Affects Version/s"" on Jira RFSW_FM-39821 updated as well;
5/ After checked with FM - ""23R4 0.1MP"" already decided to NOT pick up this WA delivery (BUT 23R4 Correction Form marked as ""Needless"" may be further checked - How about if real root cause addressed w/ valid delivery? ...)
Next Step - 
1/ Wait for 3 RRU Loads being released officially and then collect the NodeB info which contains this *WA*. 
2/ Wait for decision on GIC transition next Monday - If no decision, previous Agreement will be followed up to transfer PR to previous GIC.
2024-01-05 Fanyong [RFSW] From RFSW side - 1/ Decision of GIC changes will be postponed to next Monday but temporarily agreed to keep it in UOAM; 2/ *WA* had been merged to 23R4 thru Code Inspection - https://gerrite1.ext.net.nokia.com/q/03544639 to CTA6 #569 as RF.CTA6.23R4.20240105.001 - Ticket ""#1214 - CTA6 - 23R4"" raised to request CTA6 23R4 3-Star Official Load Release; 3/ And, confirmed in TF meeting, 24R1 and Trunk deliveries for *WA* will be propagated as well. 4/ No OT planned at this weekend from UOAM side; 5/ Furthermore, highlighted again this PR will investigate HW related issue (DDR), TF Leader addressed, and the other actions defined (Details see Teams Channel for more or https://jiradc.ext.net.nokia.com/secure/attachment/2916621/TF_Meeting_Minutes_20240105.jpg)
2024-01-05 Fanyong [RFSW] *WA* Code Inspection - https://gerrite1.ext.net.nokia.com/q/03544639 - DoD in parallel with Code Review is underway; After meeting sync with Lixiao/Steve/Wenlei, 3 comments for optimization and file being overlapped unexpectedly - All of them resolved; ""+2"" will be granted for final delivery soon
2024-01-05 Fanyong [RFSW] 1/ Agreement reached with SOC FM - Arash Miraftabi in Teams Channel to unblock WA Delivery firstly; Once WA delivery completed, PR will go back to previous GIC - SOC_L1_ASIC_TOP. Note - This WA cannot ensure PR will be closed as root cause is HW (DDR Initialization Failure in U-Boot phase); 2/ Regrading real root cause, thanks to Lixiao Ji, TF meeting request sent out and will be launched today afternoon
2024-01-04 AM: Knife for the WA is under way to be tested on site for some special RUs which has DDR initial failure issues. Waiting Intel register dumps analysis.
2024-01-03 AM: Transferred to SoC_L1_ASIC_top. If PoR really helps, that would be WA option in case after 3 recovery resets, node is still down.
2024-01-03 MPe: DDR issue so really can't be a SOC_SW issue. Maybe transfer to L1ASIC. L.Matilainen involved.

2024-01-12 S. Räty PSINT not blocked anymore, pronto to be set as RFT with the revert but still kept open to figure out the final fix
2024-01-12 Andrzej Szklarz:  Revert is done for IB.  QT tests passed for IB. Work for RC is ongoing. Logs from dbg knife are under checking. 
2024-01-11 PS_auto_request: PS REL requested for IB2312018 at 15:01:06 UTC
2024-01-11 Andrzej Szklarz:  Revert is ongoing we and developer have also OT for this. We are trying to deliver it asap but the LE was set for tomorrow.  At the same time, we are looking for RC. The investigation is also going on in parallel in the syscom and we are investigating why the knife we built passed the tests and the SW does not pass through CI. 
2024-01-10 S. Räty revert planned, it will take ~2 days LE 12.1
2024-01-09 S. Räty clarification ongoing is the 2nd knife working and we could do revert. Please note that this issue is only valid for PSINT branch. No issue in SBTS00_ENB_9999. So asked to remove TOP for 24R2

As said, I did not do the implementation for the HARQ data signal, but AFAIK software is just sending the data over the serial port. I/O voltage is not something that the software is directly controlling (especially if you say that the signal is 0.1V in the NOK case). If the observed signal looks valid and level is wrong, then to this points to something H/W related, connections, or something.
Next: discussion with tester will continue.
2024-01-12: Outi Viskari (Nokia) Initial analysis done. File: PR745223_ULPHY_Analysis.docx attached. Next: Thor SOC or platform team that is responsible for voltage setting on the connector should check this problem next. Why output voltage levels are different.

The PUCCH job(jobId:57 jobTag:0x81) had been completed successfully according to the job/dma status, then the DSP couldn't prefetch the next job CFG on job_slot_0, as we can see cfgBufferAddr = 0x0 in parsed mdab_job_info_10.txt. The function waitPrefetch() went into a dead loop because prefetchStatus couldn't be set to PREFETCH_DONE, then finally JTO.

2024-01-02: Yi A. Mao (NSB) analysis of logs on going:
From SysLog & HB, there's an error when reading SMEM/DDR for jobtag 0x81.
From parsed coreDumps, it seems DSP failed to prefetch JD Cfg section
in mdab_prefetch_info_notValid_10.txt
This test passed on SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_231211_000007 but failed on SBTS00_ENB_9999_231227_000006, I noticed there's a delivery #6448993 on Dec.20 which is related to prefetching.
Ying B. Liu (NSB)Could you please involve experts to check whether the delivery is related? Or it's the DSP crash that made it stopped at waitPrefetch()?
Next: ESP : @Niklas Sallinen will check this with Sami Pekkanen

2024-01-15: Niklas Sallinen (Nokia): 23R3 knife is now created for testing. Oulu e2e promised to get test results on Monday (LE:2024-01-15)
https://wft.int.net.nokia.com/knife_requests/1110162?project_filters=SBTS Here is the knife if there is the need to request testing faster.

2024-01-12  Niklas Sallinen (Nokia) Knife created
https://wft.int.net.nokia.com/knife_requests/1109094?project_filters=ALL The knife build is available here. We requested e2e testing for the knife to make sure that it will not introduce new errors, since it will change DMA errors to be handled as fatal errors.
Next: IR-1 will created for testing this Knife.

2024-01-11: Niklas Sallinen (Nokia) preparation of Knife on going: I'm preparing a knife to make the MHAB DMA error to be reported as a fatal error. It's just bit more more than expected originally. 
2024-01-10: Julian Ilinca (Nokia): We are still trying to reproduce this error, but the current implementation of having a non handled non fatal crash should be improved in its self which is what the knife will implement. To fully cover that knife will not cause other errors in crash handling or induce other problems we still need to organize PET testing once the knife is ready. We have started process.
2024-01-09: Julian Ilinca (Nokia) / Niklas Sallinen (Nokia) Knife implementation and testing for 23r3 to change non-fatal crash handling and not enter sleeping cell state
2024-01-08: Julian Ilinca (Nokia) / Niklas Sallinen (Nokia) Try to reproducing the fault at SCT ENV. Not yet Successful at 22R3, or 23R3 branch. 
Next: I will try to next check on 23r3 what results we get., LE: today.
2024-01-05:  Niklas Sallinen (Nokia): Song 5. Wang (Nokia) Hi Julian Ilinca (Nokia) Any findings for this issue? We discussed the problem with Miika Rajala (Nokia) and Julian Ilinca (Nokia). The non-fatal ULFE error seen soon after the cell setup. This is most probably causing the sleeping cell issue, since it breaks the ULFE JCE chaining and after that the cell is basically dead as ULFE is used to trigger the jobs and it will stop running for certain cell if the chaining breaks. Because the error is now only a non-fatal, there are no crash dumps or any further information other than the journal in the startup logs and the ULFE registers that show the WR DMA overflow. Because of this it would be really difficult to find the actual rootcause with this snapshot.
It seems that the ULFE DMA error in the newer branches cause crash and that would lead to reset and much better logs. We try to test now in the SCT if that can be reproduced. At least that could ""fix"" the issue with sleeping cell, but instead cause the crash with improved logs. 

2024-01-04: Julian Ilinca (Nokia) and GS_CSS_Radio Song 5. Wang (Nokia) continue : Cell 43 is sleeping after BTS reset:
2023-12-20T10:59:22.034Z               - 10159 230 /ffs/fs2 0x00000000 0x0000000000000000 PowerOn reset
- Issue is recovered with manually site reset.  And this snapshot was collected at Dec 31:
-Customer has power supply issue on this site, so it's reset frequently due to power outage.
Next: ESP and LAN will continue Investigation.

2024-01-03: Julian Ilinca (Nokia) check the logs, and Initial analysis done.

Next: Julian Ilinca (Nokia) and GS_CSS_Radio Song 5. Wang (Nokia) continue Analysis to indetify which ""sleepy cell"" or ""NR  ULFE crash"" is the main issue.

2024-01-15: KKj: The Correction knife is now ready and shared with CT:

(To be installed into three live sites, LE: 17-Jan)
2024-01-12: KKj: All AEQW/Made1 snapshots now analysed (10 pcs) - Only two snapshots contained the required information, but both of those pointed to the same root cause. A Correction knife for 23R3 is under verification and the aim is to share it with CT still today.
2024-01-11: KKj: IR Responded - It was found out from the logs that multiple CPU cores in masterBeamer are accessing eFramer registers which means fast_access to ATM is not used. Two proposals:
* Socsw proposal is that RFSW/FPGA release team Upgrade bitstream version from v1.0.6 to v1.0.7 which has dts with fast access to ATM to 23R3 branch
* Another proposal is that we use eFramer v3.19.x which contains newer register_bank, which should work also with overlapping read/write but fast_access is recommended as it provides 10X performance but slow access is used in this case
2024-01-10: KKj: Waiting for IR Response - The provided debug knife implemented on three sites (in field) and downloading of the logs started. In parallel, the aim is to reproduce the issue in Nokia Oulu Lab (so far, no issues seen in ongoing tests).
2024-01-09: KKj: A debug knife for lab testing in BLR now prepared and also shared for log collection in the field, as performance of the knife and log dumping has been verified:

[#Summary: ]
[#Next steps: ]
2024-01-12 [BOAM_PERFMGMT] Felix Rugina: 
- ADAPT CD2 branch failed, it seems that it is the same problem as in 24R1 branch. Some counters are not updated properly (initial issue was fixed where no counters at all where sent to Trafifica Server). Logs are under Investigation.
- Now PMStat revert is done. In master branch from BStat we found out some missing inheritance. Reviews were opened and delivered in order to not encounter old problems on BStat master branch.
- For 24R1, as in ADAPT CD2 branch, initial issue was fixed, counters are visible now in Traffica, but some of them are missing. Logs are under investigation between OK and NOK builds.
- For master correction was passed for PMStat via knife, delivery was done in PMStat but we need backward compatibility with BStat since it is now activated again, review is ongoing for master branch in BStat.
2024-01-11 [BOAM_PERFMGMT] Felix Rugina: RFT was set for CD2 branch, delivery still needed for master (it will be handled today), also we received logs from 24R1 (OK and NOK), comparation and analysis of the logs will be performed.
2024-01-10 [BOAM_PERFMGMT] Felix Rugina: Delivery was done for ADAPT_CD2 branch, preparing for master the reviews. For 24R1 OK logs not received yet.
2024-01-09 [BOAM_PERFMGMT] Felix Rugina: Waiting for pcap OK logs, from our POV correction is working in this moment. 
2024-0-08 Oana Bunas: After IR test:Well, the pcap does not catch much, neither in OK / NOK cases. As a conclusion for today:
From PM POV, in this moment the flow looks now the same as in OK build (the problem was the we didn't retry to reconnect to the server again after first failure), this was fixed and not retrial of reconnection is working. 
When we are writing to the server, at some point the connection become broken (broken pipe) and we cannot connect again; this behavior is seen in OK and NOK logs.
2024-01-08 [BOAM_PERFMGMT] Felix Rugina: Correction knife will be provided today.
2024-01-05 [BOAM_PERFMGMT] Felix Rugina: IR with debug logs + possible correction will be sent
2024-01-04 [BOAM_PERFMGMT] Felix Rugina: IR raised with additional log collection. Current logs does not contain enough information in order to make a proper analysis.

2024-01-15 L1low: common 1cc/8cc DL slot8&slot18 bler issue, waiting for draco's check result.
2024-01-13 L1low: our analysis shared in group chat as below:
1) A0/A4(called CP2 in made) in even frame(with SSB), it is highly matched with eGen log from raw constellation.
2) BIP and egen are not synchronized, but from snapshot we could see slot 18 have CRC error with 95% possibility, thus we decode five continuous slot 18 data from even sfn in egen, all show CRC pass, it means IQ data in egen is good 
That means bip and egen and CP2(A0/A4 in mars) are matched, and draco experts involved to analyze as L1low output is ok.
3) sbfc aleady checked with Maksim.
Next:
wait for draco's checking result for common 1cc/8cc slot8&slot18 common bler issue.
2024-01-12 L1low: 
From the new logs, DL slot8/slot18 blers are visible in 1cc/8cc, but some logs missing in snapshot in 1cc, will analyze the 8cc logs.
1) from previous SOC(sbfc parser) analysis, sbfc buffer is ok, that means L1low control plane output is ok
2) A0 is ok from previous analysis means L1low user plane output is ok.
Next:
map bip/egen log with sbfc buf/A0. if all of them are matched, then need draco team help to check.
2024-11 SzymonSkorupski [VRF]: IR responded, logs collected.
2024-01-11 L1low: checked the sbfc buf, it is consistent with egen log, and compare A0 even frame in slot18(bler visble) and slot28, they are same,that means A0 data also ok. from the logs, the L1low output is consistent with egen.
discussed with sbfc parser expert(Maksim), he will help continue check.
2024-01-10 L1low: current focus on 1cc DL bler issue, UL bler is ok.
analysis:
1) DL blers are in slot8&slot18 in SSB frame(each 20ms), it is special slot.
2) In slot7/slot17(before bler slot), SSB scheduled slot.
the blers are regular in slot8&slot18, will involve SOC/arch help to support sbfc related design.
2024-01-09 SzymonSkorupski [VRF]: IR responded, logs collected.
2024-01-09 L1low: test result summary uploaded, and analysis is ongoing.
2024-01-08 SzymonSkorupski [VRF]: IR responded, logs collected.
2024-01-08 L1low: wait for IR response
2024-01-06 L1low: IR sent to do below testing which sync with arch.
1) 8cc case, collect the base data as the original PR(OTA env changed)
2) 8cc without BF, compare if it is BF related issue
3) check debug knife in original test case, same as 1)
which had more improvement than last knife.
4) 1cc with BF, check if 8cc performance isue
2024-01-05 L1low: 1) PR740611 correction is not valid for the issue.
2) the new knife is related to special slot handling improvement, it had some improvement but still have bler visible, need double check the logs.
2024-01-04 SzymonSkorupski [VRF]: IR responded, tput not improved on build which contains correction for PR740611. BLER in DL comparable, in UL higher than on original load.
2024-01-04 L1low: sbfc buf is on checking.
2024-01-03 SzymonSkorupski [VRF]: IR responded, additional logs: A0 captures, sbfc buff.
2024-1-3: from FH response, no anything suspicious timing issue found, and in l1low PM counter, the packets also ontime, that means RF received the normal packets.
Next:
1) wait for IR response, and check CP2.
2) try to reproduce locally.
2024-1-2: Seems related to timing:
slot8 bler NOK in sfn2,6,10...., and from the eGen log, PTP time in this frame seems NOK.
need double check the context.
2024-1-1: New inflow, need to capture UE log and egen log to further investigation.
2023-12-29 SzymonSkorupski [ST]: IR responded, logs collected from 2xNOK case and single OK_case - more details in the IR.

https://gerrit.ext.net.nokia.com/gerrit/c/MN/L1/l1sw/+/6576324
2. FH team involved in the investigation - n2offset will be changed according to the reception window.
To be check if AP is still valid.
3. 5Gmax team simulation ongoing according provided eGen logs.  They needs to compare ABIO and ABIP data. Checking possibilities to make data injection between signal processing elements which could give feedback about ABIP issue in particular component.
Ongoing.
4. PR747725: IQ data collection and XRT issue: 
Under verification why on 24r1 and 24r2 ABIP there is no REQ file created for the BTS snapshots on IQ Data Analyzer. TF starts 16.01.
5. BOAM knife possibilities with PCID POOL config off needs to be check.
To be check if AP is still valid.
6. Debug again SCT test_thor_fh_ndm_srs_100MHz64Rx_frCfg1070_C_TDD_13.
2024-01-15 L1_SW_5G_DL_PHY_WRO: Current status:
1. NDM SRS IQ capture does not work for ABIP on 24R1 and 24R2 - pronto for this issue PR747725.
2. 5Gmax team simulation ongoing according provided eGen logs.  They needs to compare ABIO and ABIP data. Checking possibilities to make data injection between signal processing elements which could give feedback about ABIP issue in particular component.
3. FH team involved in the investigation - n2offset will be changed according to the reception window.
4. BOAM knife possibilities with PCID POOL config off needs to be check.
5. XRT team needs to verify fix for ITF46 interface.
2024-01-12 L1_SW_5G_DL_PHY_WRO: Logs from the knife has been collected and according first analysis in journal FH team should have a look on offset values printed out - CR created.
IQ data collection needs to be verified by Lanion team - there was IQ data collection interface update from 24R2 onward and this issue needs to be investigated in Lab environment. 5G max simulation ongoing.
2024-01-11 L1_SW_5G_DL_PHY_WRO: Current AP's with priorities:
a) debug knife preparation to check job timing sequence and buffers LE: 11.01. testing results LE: 12.01.
knife draft ready: https://gerrit.ext.net.nokia.com/gerrit/#/c/MN/L1/l1sw/+/6559269/ 
b) IQ data collection with suspicious event for NDM SRS which has some limitations and collect only 1 event.
This is separate investigation handled by L1 TL to save time on FiVE TL and secure field IQ logs collection possibilities on customer side
c) Retest with newest SW to check if we have the same issue symptoms LE: 12.01.
d) Execute 5Gmax simulation were the same SRS data goes separately through ABIO and ABIP then compare output if it's exactly the same LE: 13.01.
e) run SCT tests with L3 call to see if issue could be reproduced because SCT without L3 call is not visible
2024-01-10 L1_SW_5G_DL_PHY_WRO: Current AP's:
a) Collected IQ data and IQ data collection with python script under verification LE: 10.01.
live debug session done - logs verification ongoing LE: 10.01. if next session needed will be done 10.01.
b) SCT generation from XRT possible with SnapshotMatlabScriptTranslator.py upgrade from review stage - verification LE: 10.01. 
c) Performance knife to check platform issue e.g. can't handle 28 MDAB that start at the same time by reduce the number of MDAB that can use THOR to the number of MDAB used by LOKI (7):
SBTS link: https://wft.int.net.nokia.com/knife_requests/1107048?project_filters=ALL
Knife did not bring performance improvement. 
d) Matlab simulation with eGen Based SRS IQ injection and analysis - simulator verification LE: 11.01.
e) Knife: NDM SRS jobs could be run earlier , run COMA with max 2 streams Wiktor Konarski LE: 10.01. 
f) Run SRS SCT test that was failing in the past: test_thor_fh_ndm_srs_100MHz64Rx_frCfg1070_C_TDD_13 – looks like python script issue and not the same problem like in pronto but needs confirmation LE: 09.01. by Sukru Arslan - done
g) Suspicious point: Job which copy data: polarization 0 coma in uldata_srsreceiverespbmps not match with the coma in our egen analyze tool. while the polarization 1 coma matches
h) retest with 1 UE done - logs under analysis LE: 10.01.
2024-01-09 L1_SW_5G_DL_PHY_WRO: Current AP's:

2024-01-07 L1_SW_5G_DL_PHY_WRO: Deeper Investigation on L1 processing of the SRS data to be done. Now we can only prove that the issue is not in Radio and potentially in L1. 
Most probable suspect of the issue is to be in HV CoMa Processing in L1. Investigation and TF continues.

2023-12-28 [MCTRL] tanasie; the first schema is triggered after topology for antenna mapping is created inside sandbox (the problem that I see is that we have the schema triggered for the bbtop of runtime) and the second one is triggered due to outside deployemnt, due to both being on the runtime bbtop and the previous one not being done executing yet, MCTRL cleaned the old one to execute the new one.
Fix would be to trigger the schema inside sandbox after the antenna mapping inside sandbox is done thus no collision between sandbox and normal deployment.
Knife to be provided today since this might produce undesirable results under different scenarios.

2023-12-27 - L2-HI BLR - debug knife is ready based on dichotomy test result will take next action.
Dichotomy test is ongoing to identify the first failing build. The dichotomy test was planned to take care in same IR but PR author has closed the IR without agreement. Hence new IR was not created to continue on dichotomy test; 
Tester is continuing to test for build isolation that helps to identify/narrow down problematic commits.
Just in case if dichotomy does not provide any information, debug knife is kept ready in parallel to start the investigation; For this debug knife new IR will be created when debug knife will be started for testing.
2023-12-26 - L2-HI BLR - dichotomy test -  testing team will try another build between SBTS00_ENB_9999_231212_000006 and SBTS00_ENB_9999_231214_000001

rdMinAdaptiveSlotProcessingRatio_perCent (0x822) = 90030078
and another run with
rdMaxAdaptiveSlotProcessingRatio_perCent (0x821) = 90090078
this is to test how much reducing the flucations caused by CB012716 affects the KPI
and also whether the issues are more cause by too low or too high values
2024-01-08 [L2PS_BLR]: Since PET test was not done on correction provided trunk build for PR742138 , and considering that on trunk actAdaptiveSchedulerBudgetOlc = true by default, so can we test the scenario on build SBTS00_ENB_9999_231219_000006 by disabling the actAdaptiveSchedulerBudgetOlc. So that we can confirm that it didn't introduced any new issues or it actually helped in resolving the issue in trunk or not in the first place. IR raised, awaiting response.
2024-01-04 SwapnilK:From CB012716 perspective the only likely impact would be the occasional increase in the number of UL scheduled UEs. But it is unclear how this could possibly cause a KPI degradation.the low values of adativeSlotProcessingRatio are misleading and should be improved but are not the root cause for this Pronto. A possible impact that CB012716 can have on the overall test run is that it occasionally allows for more scheduling time compared to the feature being inactive, i.e., whenever adativeSlotProcessingRatio is above 78 which was the previous limit. This results in a larger CS1 list size and more scheduled UEs.
From the CB012716 feature perspective this is intended behaviour as we want to spend as much time as possible with scheduling. additional test runs with either CB012716 active or CB012716 inactive both had degraded KPI for this test scenario 
2024-01-03 SwapnilK: the very low slotRatio for DL as set by load balancing looks to be responsible for the unintended behavior of CB012716, which then causes the KPI degradation, so the issue is an unintended interaction between these two features which the PR735822 was aiming to fix. IR results being analysed for actAdaptiveSchedulerBudgetOlc = true vs false results with build SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_231215_000020
2024-01-02 [L2PS_Ulm]: CB012716 impact being checked, actAdaptiveSchedulerBudgetOlc as False as a quick WA being thought of

2023-12-27 [L2PS_BLR]: awaiting for IR response.
2023-12-26 [L2PS_BLR]: from the 24R1 OK logs, observed adativeSlotProcessingRatio as zero and in the trunk build where issue is produced could see some values(varying between 30-90) and the CS1 list size restricted to zero. So IR raised to re-run the test case by disabling ""actAdaptiveSchedulerBudgetOlc"" one build before/prior to the  trunk build where revert/corrections provided for PR742138 in trunk.
2023-12-22 [L2PS_BLR]: when the fix for PR742138 was ported to trunk on build SBTS00_ENB_9999_231215_000021, this scenario is not run(PET test).

2024-01-02: Mika Kempas: New IN transfer (RF.SRM7 AVQL), uCCSRT AaTrbl analysis is needed 
2023-12-29: Grzegorz Huppert (Nokia): Reason for Transfer: Pronto incorrectly transferred. *uboot_pm issue introduced with correction for PR739187 where check of maximum 6MB file size transfer limit was intoduced.
2023-12-29: Charles Yan (NSB): Reason for Transfer: Document issue in trbl_log_list.csv, please update bootware part, then transfer to next component.
2023-12-29 Charles Yan [RFSW]: the test script only check files with mandatory flag = 1, most probably the script will uncompress all the compressed files recursively, then do the search only for leaf node, return failure if file not found. Most probably documentation issue, double confirm with RFSW CI lead.

2024-01-09 [MCUHWAPI] Kewin Wozny: At 23:22 we see that all RP3 links on murkku are in sync along with the link that is connected to the second FSMF. Next step: AIF to clarify why FID476 is visible on their side. TF meeting is planned on Tue 09.01 at 10am CET. 
2024-01-08 [MCUHWAPI] Kewin Wozny: PR has been rejected from BOAM with reason: BB_CAPACITY is not responsible for FSMF reset. Additionally reset in question occurs at 23:29:02, while RP3BusNotSynchronized issues appear on DSP starting from 23:23:25. BB_MCU_BASEBAND to check. TF meeting is planned 
2024-01-04 [MCUHWAPI] Kewin Wozny: Still checking logs. At the end all RP3 links are synchronized but in mentioned time in AIF analysis propably FSMF modules lost synchronization between SMODs.

2024-01-10 T.Isomaki: Tester is requesting a vDU package from the knife, as the FW is not properly installed with l1sw knife.
2024-01-09 H.Turunen: We suspect that correct vdu-thor-fw.img was not properly updated with the previous IR. IR330835 is now raised to test again.
2024-01-08 H.Turunen: With IR330376 debug knife we could not find what was expected from the console logs, there might be something wrong with the knife build. We'll try this knife with local RINLINE2 board to find out if there is some problem in the knife itself or is it related to logs provided by the pronto author. Anyways, the outcome of resetting link ""manually"" from RINLINE side is that the link can be recovered by this action.
R330452 was also raised to try if turning SFP laser off and back on link partner (Dell switch) side helps. The results is that also this makes link to recover.
2024-01-08 T.Isomaki: IR replied with logs to be checked.
2024-01-05 H.Turunen: IR330376 raised to test a debug knife in order to get more  insight what happens in the ATF during link-bringup.
2024-01-04 V.Hurme: Link bring-up issue has been found. Serdesutil data will be collected. Debug knife design and implementation was started.

Next: analyzing new log of IR-4

Next: to check if knife-testing baseon Original SW would be needed or not.
2024-01-10 :  L1_SW_CTRL_OUL : Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia) IR-3 responded, but fault was not reproduced, I cannot find MDAB crashes. Only MHAB and one SIGSEGV from RT side.
Next: proposal to build the same Knife based on Original BASESW: SBTS00_ENB_9999_231220_000020, Hopefully, MDAB crash could be preproduced. for analyzing the root cause
2024-01-09 :  L1_SW_CTRL_OUL : Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia) IR-3 responded with new logs. Next: new logs will be analysed.
2024-01-08 :  L1_SW_CTRL_OUL : Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia) and testability team: Uula Ollila (Nokia): Prepare debug-knife. We probably can extract the used buffer sizes from the collected MDAB crashbuffer, when we get proper logs from the target.
2024-01-05  Uula Ollila (Nokia): prepare correction Knife with Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia) gerrite:  https://gerrit.ext.net.nokia.com/gerrit/c/MN/L1/l1sw/+/6522805
Next:  Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia) above gerrite  review's purpose is to fix ICACHE, IMEM + CACHE TAG RAM collection.
But there is also another problem on Loki side, when collecting HW trace.  Which needs a fix as well.  And I'm also doing a knife for this pronto on top of SBTS00_ENB_9999_231227_000003

2024-01-04 testability team: Uula Ollila (Nokia): join the investigation from  Hello, I just returned from vacation. As Ari states above, the problem for the missing dumps should be clear now.
The copy of the copy of CevaRsasBuffers must be created in the RT side. I fixed this in December. It was previously done in NRT. If the recovery starts in the RT-side before we do the copy, the buffers are overwritten before copying and we lose everything. That is why it needs to be in the RT-app. Review: https://gerrit.ext.net.nokia.com/gerrit/c/MN/L1/l1sw/+/6229413
 But I did not touch the cevaRsasDumpIntMem then. So now the dumping is done after the copying and therefore not included in the file. So we have to move cevaRsasDumpIntMem to handleMdabFatalError before we create any core specific memory copies. Do you agree Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia)? Do we also want to dump this intmem for SSO-triggered crashes (detected internally in the DSP and ARM not triggering handleMdabFatalError)? In that case we have to make sure that dumping is also done somewhere during the isolation if it is not done in handleMdabFatalError.
And is Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia) already creating some kind of build knife to solve this? If not, Pavel Goncharov (Nokia) can continue from Espoo testability team.

2023-12-22: L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_ESP: Niklas Sallinen: initial analysis on going with platform expert: Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia)
-  CB008950 FOT: Jianjun B. Du (NSB): XianMing Song (Nokia) This feature has no L1 impact  during CB008950's FS2 phase , so does CFAM phase.  There are L2/L3 Optimization , however we still keep legacy - 10 Active CA relations , no L1 impact.  Thus the suspect should be common L1 issue in trunk. .  
- Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia): Sami Pekkanen (Nokia)
At least for my eyes it looks same but there now dsp memory is totally corrupted...
The reason why it looks corrupted is that someone did modifications to cevaRsasShared structure to its syslog parts.
When the structure is changed its version number should upgrade as well:
0x00000008:   sharedStructVersion = 0x2 = 2
Now it is still ""the old one""  and  because of it, shrink fails to extract the data from it
Next: Ari Kumpumaki (Nokia): prepare correction-knife to be tested.
Okay. Problem found, and next I'll fix it.. Someone did some modifications to the dump collection and didn't test it . That change broke other things there too

[2024-01-12] Xu Liyun: after further check, we also observed the degradation of RSSI. for the decreased of SINR/RSSI, currently we involved L1 UL experts to check together(a CR to L1). On the other hand, CIS expert is trying to reset the site to see if the KPI can recover or not.
[2024-01-11] Xu Liyun: Confirmed again with the testers there is no SW change around 30th of Nov. Will check the SINR KPI today. CNN candidate.
[2024-01-10] Zheng Zhilong. According to the new findings, the symptom might be caused by SINR degradation at the end of Nov.
[2024-01-09][Xu Liyun] Due to network freezes CIS are not allowed to make changes to the high runner. Expected resume on 8.1.2024 US time. But no response from CIS so far. 
[2023-12-29][Xu Liyun] Due to network freezes CIS are not allowed to make changes to the high runner. 
[2023-12-28] Xu Liyun: IR raised for the same actions yesterday. 
[2023-12-27] Zheng Zhilong: Waiting for CIS support's update on the 2 actions: 1)  change back the cell reselection priority to see if the KPI is back or not; 2) get the logs before&after this change. 
[2023-12-26] Zheng Zhilong: We don't know what is behavior of cell reselection priority change and we didn't get any of the related logs for that. If someone from CIS can provide the diff before and after the change, we can make some investigation. 
[2023-12-25] Zheng Zhilong: CIS team confirmed that there was a cell reselection priority change on Nov 30th. We think this could be the root cause. Next step: When US team is back to office, we will double check with them and CNN the case possibly.
[2023-12-22] Zheng Zhilong: CIS confirmed that there is no configuration change. but if we look at those highlighted cells' statistic from KPI file of site DA01856A, we will easily find that the NR5076B degradation happened near NOV 30th which is 6 day ahead of the SW upgrading date, so we think the degradation is not caused by sw upgrading, we should figure out what happened at the end of November, and it's useless to compare the diff between 23R2 with 24R1. We still need CIS's inputs on the possible change during Nov 30. on the high runner site.
[2023-12-21]Zheng Zhilong: The KPI degradation appeared after Nov 30th, but the upgrading happened on Dec 6th, so the symptom is not introduced by SW upgrading, need Local team to figure out what happened at the end of Novemeber.
[2023-12-20]Xu Liyun: Continue to check the algorithm change betwen 23R3 and 24R1. 23R2 to 24R1, 64QAM MCS degrade a little on some sites.
Checked algorithm change doc. 6 items may related to 5076b. FDD 20M will not impact. Today CIS provided the 23R2 log. We are checking this logs. We also requested the daily KPI data for the investigation.

2024-01-12  Oana Bunas: Knife correction seems to work, log are beeing checked.
2024-01-11 [PERFMGMT] Daiana Popa: New debug knife created. IR open
2024-01-11 Oana Bunas: IR responded logs under check, knife failed, conclusion expected today
2024-01-10 [PERFMGMT] Daiana Popa: knife with possible fix from PMStat pov provided. IR open.
2024-01-10 [PERFMGMT] : knife is building, will create IR when it's ready
2024-01-09 [PERFMGMT] Daiana Popa: as stated in teams chat:

From BStat/PMStat pov these are the findings so far:
Original Issue from this pronto was reported on both binaries BStat and PMStat on 18 Dec and since we have seen it occuring in BStat also, we have concluded it is not a PMStat specific issue.
Also, the original problem with M8010C74 having no updates on some the cells, was fixed by RUMAG revert, released in SBTS00_ENB_9999_231224_000003
But in the same build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231224_000003), in PMStat code, another significant change was delivered, impacting measurement configuration & counter collector part of PMStat, which was faulty and generated lots of other prontos and which is also impacting the reporting of M8010C74&75 even though RUMAG revert fixed the original issue seen in counter provider part of PMStat.
I am now working on fix for the latter mentioned issue in PMStat and will provide knife asap

2024-01-08 [PERFMGMT] ogircin: investigation ongoing, counter seems to be visible in pm files

2024-01-08 [CPlane/Timi] Mihaela Drondu: waiting for field reproduction to get new logs that cover the moment of the issue
2024-01-05 [Cplane/Timi] Mihaela Drondu: current logs don't cover moment of issue and without them investigation can't continue. Waiting for reproduction and new logs.
2024-01-04 [Cplane/Timi] Andreea Georgescu: SyVe and PET reproduction failed. IR for NPI team created. W4LE from NPI team about LE for the reproduction. 
2024-01-03 [Cplane/Timi] Mihaela Drondu: waiting for SyVe reproduction https://jiradc.ext.net.nokia.com/browse/SFCCR-1248
2023-12-29 [Cplane/Timi] Andreea Georgescu: from development PoV it is not possible to check with analysis until Lab reproduction is successful. SyVe reproduction planned to be started in cw01.2024 
2023-12-28 [Cplane/Timi] Andreea Georgescu: not possible to advance with analysis until Lab reproduction is successful. until now not possible to be reproduced on PET, checking with SyVe team if they could reproduce the behavior. SyVe team will start with issue reproduction on 29.12 
2023-12-27 [Cplane/Timi] Andreea Georgescu: reproduction at PET level is not yet confirmed to be consistent with the behavior of the PR
2023-12-22 [Cplane/Timi] Benjamin Miklo: New logs from PET (Leon Oelen) were provided, he mentioned that after checking the KPI history, he observed that there have been similar KPI drops in the same cell type: AHFII FDD cell 12, on older SW and without CB010240 being activated.
2023-12-21 [Cplane/Timi] Mihaela Drondu: new logs from Elisa provided, but KPI degradation is only observed in TMO and not in Elisa so we need to rely on PET reproduction for time being for this issue, still waiting for new logs from PET ticket https://jiradc.ext.net.nokia.com/browse/SFCCR-1248
2023-12-20 [CPlane/Timi] Mihaela Drondu: ticket created for internal reproduction https://jiradc.ext.net.nokia.com/browse/SFCCR-1248 waiting for new logs 
2023-12-19 [CPlane/Timi] Vlad Slivilescu: IR sent, further logs are needed as no problematic UE can be found in the current logs.

[#Next steps: ]
2024-01-15 L2HI TD: Knife on Elisa site has been uploaded. Log collection ongoing.
2024-01-12 L2HI TD: Basing on logs and analysis made so far a refined knife has been prepared to dive deeper into the problem. Awaiting knife retest and delivery of logs. 
2024-01-11 L2HI AT: there is still lot of places when 5904 is smaller than 5905 after 24h test, we need to discuss if new knife is needed or such results are acceptable, TF meeting scheduled for today to discuss current logs and next steps 
2024-01-10 L2HI TD: 24h run ongoing. As per info from Timo Lehesvuori we will have 24H KPI's today afternoon
2024-01-09 L2HI TD: Initial feedback from knife testing (TMO sanity checks ) is positive however logs collected so far (elisa) are too short to give final verdict or to do a deep dive. Requested to run at lest a 24h stabi run as the problem is occasional and it may happen that the fault is not observed for even hours.
2024-01-08 L2HI TD: All AP to L2hi resolved. Exploratory fix knife is ready but it will be decided on today's sync call when there will be a change to test it.
2024-01-04 L2HI TD [Post sync-call update] 5 AP identified. 4 on L2hi side 1 on test team wrt local reproduction. 2 AP from L2hi side to be completed today, the rest over the weened (no guarantees as topic is quite elaborate)
2024-01-04 L2HI TD: Potentially scenarios in which there is a mismatch between Lo and Hi has been identified. Tech discussion ongoing with L2Lo on ways to prove/reject current hypothesis. 
2024-01-03 L2HI AT: from latest logs we can see that duration reported in L2-HI counter is about 10 times greater than duration reported in L2-LO counter, we are still looking for an explanation for this phenomenon, conclusion should be ready today
2024-01-02 L2HI AT: continuing investigation on L2HI
2023-12-29 [L3] Andreea Georgescu: from L3 PoV, everything works as expected, L2 should check next
2023-12-28 [L3] Andreea Georgescu analysis ongoing on Cplane level. checking with L2Hi about the fact that there are UEs that are not configured with CA resulting in empty secondaryL2LoParams for those cases, which is intended behavior, however we do not see any information that this secondaryL2LoParams is empty in cases of FR1 CA.
2023-12-27 [L3] Andreea Georgescu: checking cases when CP-RT sends empty secondaryL2LoParams to L2HI. next step: still investigation on CP-RT level
2023-12-22 L2HI TD: L2Lo and CP involved into the investigation. There is something obviously unclear regarding FR1 vs FR2 bearer recognition what is the base for KPI calculation. Currently CP need to comment on that as it seems to be the source of this info. 
2023-12-21 L2HI TD: 03531221 case attached. Logs were provided for the 03531221 case so IR will still be in place. CT needs to indicate the moment of fault in the provided logs and then R&D assessment will follow.
2023-12-20  kulmacz:  Timo Lehesvuori has provided logs with requested R&D flags
2023-12-20 L2HI TD: IR pending. Ensuring that local reproduction attempts are made in the meantime. 
2023-12-19 L2HI TD: Seems that there will a problem with case reproduction due to holiday freeze. Discussion ongoing on ways to proceed. 
2023-12-18 L2HI TD: IR raised for debug level log collection. 
2023-12-16 L2HI TD: initial screening started.

2024-1-12 Anne: In the new solution, update ticket of BOAM_APPS PFS is ready for review. Next Step: wait for approval
2024-1-10 Dlphy: A new solution: Add trace Id field in the stop trace message sent to L1 from OAM.
It need spec document, webEm and OAM update. DLPHY has support this solution, but need to confirm for Loner, Because OAM is common for Loner and others.
2024-1-9 Dlphy: TraceId#50 and traceId#35 issue will be the potential short-term solution to PR743426 and PR745555. 
L1Dlphy Correction - trace id 35 and 50 are active/enabled by default. Those should not be disabled when any L1 trace is disabled. 
WebEm Correction - traceId#35 and traceId#50 will be removed from WebEm list.
Document Correction - update specification document accordingly - traceId#35's default is on
2024-1-8 Dlphy: Need tester to confirm the use case of stopping partial trace.
2024-1-5 Dlphy: A&S believe it has been the implementation since day 1 that all L1 traces are stopped together. Need tester to confirm the use case of stopping partial trace.
2024-1-4 Dlphy: Need clarification from system A&S.
2023-12-29 Dlphy: To be discussed with system A&S.
2023-12-28 Dlphy: To be discussed with system A&S.
2023-12-27 Dlphy: no progress due to holiday
2023-12-26 Dlphy: no progress due to holiday
2023-12-25 Dlphy: involved A&S expert to discuss the improvement after holiday  
2023-12-22 Dlphy: L1 and oam's implementation are aligned with BTSC_L1_Req_4650. however, from tester operation view, it is not reasonable. If requirement needs adaption will be discussed with A&S.
2023-12-21 Dlphy: 
1 Should this ""start again desired traceid values"" be automatically done by OAM?
2 Currently WebEM shows that one trace is stopped and other traces are still continued normally. However under the hood all L1 traces are stopped and the other L1 traces are not started by system. - WebEM shows as an active L1 traces. 
3 Do we have a technical limitations somewhere to stop just one trace?
These questions need the answer from OAM.
2023-12-20 Dlphy: 
Currenly in case of ""action"" ""Stop"" only length of the L1Log_TraceReq-traces array 0 is sent by OAM, so if OAM wants to stop any trace types and keep other traces, it needs firstly stop all the traces and start again with desired traceId values. So stop one stream will stop all the streams meet the requirements.
BTSC_L1_Req_4650
https://gates.nsn-net.net/view/0001f126#o=902&hlt
2023-12-19 Dlphy: the length of L1Log_TraceReq is 0, DLPHY will disable all the active streams if the length is 0. Need OAM team to check why it is 0, is it normal if only disable one stream?

Next : New Debug-knife-2,  Debug-knife-3, created, IR-3  create to test new knife, and new logs will be analyzed.
2023-12-19: Xianming Song Transfer to L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_ESP assign to Espoo3 team: Topi Hanninen (Nokia) to investigation ra_time point of view.
2023-12-19:Chen Hong: IR ""Please retest 10 times with original SW to see is this permanent"". Each time issue is reproduced, it takes time to restore the environment. IR takes a longer time to reply. So far, it's been repeated five times.

2023-12-19: Co-analysis on going with HZH .Ming S Chen + ESP: Topi Hanninen (Nokia) + Platform expert: Tomi Saalanto (Nokia): Also request tester to do binary search between OK and NOK release.
Next: Initial analysis will continue

2023-12-19: Xianming Song :  Transfer to L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_HZH team: Assign to Ming S Chen to Start UL_PHY Initial analysis with L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_ESP: Topi Hanninen (Nokia): ra_time expert to co-analysis

2023-12-18: Xianming Song : Chat created, L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_HZH team @Ming S Chen to start ""pre-analysis""  with tester and L1_SW_Plaform 
- Tester:  Hong 1. Chen (NSB): In addition, PR743338 appears in vDUCNF00_0.300.18279. But before this, there is PR742639 (OAM PR closed), which causes the whole vDU to reset automatically after reset rannic. After the vDU reset automatically, the cell state is normal. PR742639 correction is vDUCNF00_0.300.18279. So can we assume that vDUCNF00_0.300.18279 is the first failed build? Or do we need to find the first build where PR742639 occurs?
Next: PR will be assign to team/experts after Pre-analysis concluded.

2024-01-09 Grzegorz Majewski: Got logs from IR. They show that it's possible to manually read SFP properties after the issue appears. It confirms that TRS tries to read them too early. Will provide them example code snipped, showing how to use system poll() function. But need to confirm this with more experienced colleague - Przemyslaw Gacka.
2024-01-09 Grzegorz Majewski: IR sent to tester.
2024-01-09 Grzegorz Majewski: possible root cause - TRS doesn't poll on SFP status event. Will need to ask tester for additional information when error occurs, which would confirm that polling on event will fix the issue.
2024-01-03 Grzegorz Majewski: analyzing code snippets provided by TRS, writing testbench app which mimic TRS behavior
2023-12-28 Grzegorz Majewski: Analysis attached. Please send to TRS for additional info.
2023-12-28 Grzegorz Majewski: From the driver point of view it looks like TRS tries to access SFP too early, before it is announced as ready. From TRS point of view - they said they poll SFP status, and wait until it is ready. Can't verify this because don't have the access to their src code repo. Asked for help to gain access (Niyaz Hassan), but he is absent till 03.01. In the meantime I'm trying to write mock app which uses the same poll mechanism as TRS said, so I hope it can reproduce the issue and the driver will be able to find a fix.

2024-01-15 SZajaczkowski [RFSW]: Investigation is ongoing - the LE for it is 16/01 EoB, as the topic is complex and we have some additional TOP PRs to investigate.
2024-01-12 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Investigation still ongoing - there was the discussion raised about some differences in SCFC's, but it was clarified and we could investigate it further.
2024-01-11 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Additional lead was found and is under checking - we should be able to clarify if it's valid and provide next steps till EoB.
2024-01-10 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] During binary search we were not able to reach the previously reported OK time of 25.8s - after questions it was clarified, that during the search the config was changed. Whether we should see different times in case of config change (our first guess is yes) is to be confirmed, then possibly the new IR will be raised and investigation will continue on recently shared logs. Next steps to be clarified EoB.
2024-01-08 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Binary search is ongoing, for now the tester has tested builds #4747, #4489 and #4199 and all of these has the change of time already introduced. To be found: the build when time is as reported originally (25.8s).
2024-01-05 Kong Xiangli: There need more time to do binary search retesting with different SW version.Ongoing.LE:2024-01-08
2024-01-04 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Suspicion still stands - binary search was requested from our side, the first test(s) are to be done on SBTS00_ENB_9999_231009_000019, which is in half of NOK - OK range. No LE for testing.
2024-01-03 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Additional deviation is possibly coming outside of radio. The investigation is ongoing, no LE for findings yet.
2024-01-03 VKuzyk: [RFSW]:  no other deviations of time execution for actions within draco was noticed (except DAPD related) during TX carrier deactivation. Average difference of HLAPI transaction execution is ~2.6s, which could be explained by dirty-rf changes. Seems that addition difference is not related to HLAPI transaction execution in draco.
2023-12-29 MKrawczynski: [RFSW] Test showed some improvement 
It seems OK vs NOK difference is (on average) ~5,5s.
And dirty-rf part of it is 2,85s, so around half of it.
The change in maxNumberOfConcurrentSlowRecipes was needed because rfsw was overloading the memeory leading to random crashes in some customer cases. So reverting this change is not really an option
 we need to look for other conditions that impact the time here. Draco team asked to look into this further. Waiting for their response
2023-12-28 MKrawczynski: [RFSW] IR raised to run tests again after modified the value maxNumberOfConcurrentSlowRecipes to 3 in scheduler.json file. Testing ongoing
2023-12-27 MKrawczynski: [RFSW] Case to be assigned, possible next steps to be shared earliest tomorrow

2024-01-15 NMucharska [RFSW] CT sees gap in the documentation. What is more, they point out that the customer won't accept A&S explanation when there is no beamforming. Discussion with them is ongoing. FDD cells with these kinds of abnormal behavior should be correlated with field/configuration activities and other KPIs /alarm reports. Awaiting LE
2024-01-12 NMucharska [RFSW] A&S expert clarified that as we use fixed beams (ie we select the best and second-best beams from available beams), the difference in rtwp depends on the location of UE within these beams. eg if the UE is in exactly the center (or the point with the highest beam gain) of the best beam, the difference could be higher. But if the UE lies somewhere in the middle of the two beams, the difference will be less. That would be an explanation for behaviour described in pronto.

2024-01-04 NMucharska [RFSW] A&S gave feedback that in most of the cases, the best beam occupies streams 0&1, and the second best beam occupies streams 2&3. So below observation is expected as the gain on the best beam will always be better than the second-best beam. It explains imbalance of streams but we need to analyse if it can affect that much.

Investigation why we have so many UlPmiRiFallBackTimers  in one slot is ongoing. 

Top 3 timers expired:
e001/223 - sumimoUlPmiRiFallBackExpiry, 
302/16 - l2psDrxOnDurationStartTimer,
303/16 l2psDrxOnDurationStopTimer

In Syslog there is lot prints about missing resources for SRS:
cp-rt : [SRS]Not enough symbols to be used to allocate periodic AntennaSwitch srs resource,…
l2-ps : 
-SrsBmOverloadControl.cpp:58 SRS EO Overload detected 
-INF/L2-PS/src/ul/sch/fd/AvailablePrbUtil.cpp:49 SRS PRB 216 is larger than available PUSCH PRB 162

There are lots of  timeout for PSRS
PSRS suMimoExpiryCallback: Ue(XXX) timeout 
it is also before error appear. 

In TTI there is no srsReceiveRespPs

[2024-01-15]F. Roosen : checking of TTI traces for UEs with low traffic and PF metric behavior
[2024-01-13] PET/Joonas: IR testing ongoing, reply in still today
[2024-01-12]F. Roosen : Test on ABIP with rdEnableMcsPrbReductionFdm (default 0x1x1) set to 0x1x0 (0x580280=0x1x0) to disable reduction for DL - no impact on throughput (see IR331442). New knife has been created to test an Eth factor 10 instead of 2 - IR331496
[2024-01-10]ELOURAJINI: changing the backhaul connection from 10Go to 25Go help improve the tpt by ~20%. From L2ps pov we see that the ETH in ABIO case is always higher (double) than the ETH in ABIP. we think that this is influenced by the fact that the cs1List size in ABIP is double the size of itss counterpart in ABIO. We are creating a knife to remedy that.
[2024-01-09] PET/Joonas: IR requested run started with 24R1 2.0PD load which is 24R1_450 load
[2024-01-08]ELOURAJINI: investigation on l2ps side is ongoing. Checking examples of UEs degraded in tpt to see if we can spot a clue.
[2024-01-06]PET/Tommi T: IR runs ongoing, will be responded today.
[2024-01-05]ELOURAJINI: results from IR330184 are not valid. Config of enhancedDtxOptimized are set to true but request was to set them to false as in ABIO case. Retest is requested.
[2024-01-04]ELOURAJINI:Test with maxNumPdschAllocationPerSlot limited to 6 did not help tpt levels but it had a negative effect. test with newer build is helping reach 2.9Gbps. Comparing the logs now.
[2023-12-18]ELOURAJINI:l2ps has same behavior as previous tests. l2ps is limited by data in buffers. we saw a difference in NR_371a 5G PDCP SDU throughput received over F1-U in DL at gNB-DU (Mbit/s). TRS said it's pushing same data levels to l2Hi. L2HI need to explain the difference in f1-U
interface.
[2023-12-17] PET/Joonas: IR requested multiple tests ongoing.. LE for response today

[2023-12-16]L2PS plicata:
Several tests with UEs only one cell on ABIP have been done (cell1, cell2, cell3), without HO wth UEs on all cells.  ABIO tests will be done on Sunday. 
By comparing KPIs, we see that the modulation on ABIP is lower than ABIO, e.g.: 
NR_242a 5G Percentage of PDSCH transmissions using low MCS codes (MCS 0-9) (%) ABIO 31.16; ABIP 59.58  
NR_243a 5G Percentage of PDSCH transmissions using high MCS codes (MCS 20-28) (%) ABIO 36.22; ABIP 18.17 

2023-12-15 PET/Joonas: IR requested L2PS flag tried and results delivered via PR tool and Teams.
2023-12-14 PET/Joonas: IR requested logs collected from ABIO and ABIP. Delivered also via Teams
[2023-12-15]ELOURAJINI:l2ps is scheduling more UEs. loqtime is lower in ABIP not enough data to echedule: questions asked for l2hi. We tried limiting the cs1 list size to try to limit ABIP performance in scheduling but it did not help. l2ps continue to investigate. next is to test with one cell to iliminate the pooling effect.
[2023-12-13]ELOURAJINI: from tti traces the impact on tpt is mainly coming from smaller used mcs. the mcs in this case is downgraded based on buffer levels. buffer levels are down compared to ABIO case. loqtime is lower, cqi is same, we schedule more UEs per slot in ABIP case. next step: is to recollect more representative logs to see if the problem is from logs collected in deffrent phases of test or there is a problem in data flow.","unknown","SBTS00 No LE Set, SBTS24R1 No LE Set, SBTS24R1 1.0PD No LE Set","[object Object], [object Object], [object Object]","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/qc/?prontos=%22PR742905%22"",""3"")","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/qc/?all_prontos=%22PR742905%22"",""3"")","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/test-runs/?end_db=36500&pronto=%22PR742905%22"",""3"")",0,,33,"Investigating","SBTS24R1","2 - Critical","Permanent","B - Major","TOP1_24R1-SR_3.0PD","CR1465189 | SBTS00 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS00_ENB_9999_xxx_yyy | Correcting | , CR1465190 | SBTS24R1 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS24R1_ENB_0000_xxx_yyy | Correcting | , CR1468959 | SBTS24R1 1.0PD | LE: No LE Set | SBTS24R1_ENB_0000_000306_yyy_CNA | Needless | 2023-12-27 06:17:25+01","TOP1_24R1-SR_3.0PD","Joonas Kukkonen (Nokia)","NIOYRPET8","Satu Saaristo (Nokia)","ECE_DEV_FPS_UP_L2_PS","Vincent Couillot (Nokia)","MN RAN L2 SW 1 NPS","Loic Taton (Nokia)",,"MN RAN L2","Kimmo Virkki (Nokia)","MN RAN","Niko Lalu (Nokia)","Olivier Buob (Nokia)","Jari Siltavirta (Nokia), Muneender Chiranji (Nokia)","CR1465189   5G_SC_SW_UP_L2_PS, CR1465190   5G_SC_SW_UP_L2_PS, CR1468959  Dennis Xie (NSB) ECE_DEV_FPS_UP_L2_PS","L2-PS","5G Radio","5G Radio","System_KPI","2023-12-13T07:04:27",,33,"[2023-12-13 09:08 - Kubicz Michal]: [Not a blocker] ABIP issue and it is not used yet in CDIT+D

2024-01-15 [Wojciech Konieczny] Our team had all day  training at Friday. PR has been reassigned  - I'm continuing investigation today.
2024-01-12 [Mikołaj Chyła] RFSW do not see any issue from Router pov in given NOK logs that could cause TS_MISM and no differences to given OK logs configuration.As a next step it would be good to check with another FRMC, as suggested by HW expert.
2024-01-11 [Mikołaj Chyła] No notable differences between OK and NOK logs from the MCU HWAPI BBB perspective. I believe the next logical step is for the RF SW team to compare the ok and nok logs to see if is there any difference in the initial link/routing configuration [or in the RAT rest specific actions?] on the radio module side
2024-01-10: [Mikołaj Chyła] I was blocked in finishing my analysis yesterday by the ammount of meetings we had. I have it almost ready, will post it today (this  is prio1, I will avoid other things to finish today).
2024-01-09: [Mikołaj Chyła] Comparing OK/NOK logs. LE: EOB.
2024-01-08: [Mikołaj Chyła] OK_case logs provided and question to OAM answered on chat. Next step is to compare the OK and NOK logs using the additional informations
2024-01-04: [Tomasz Nowicki] OK_case with logs and snapshot are on rotta on path \\eseefsn50.emea.nsn-net.net\rotta4internal\LTE_2\tnowicki\PR742784\OK_case
2024-01-03: [Mikołaj Chyła] Analysis of the currently available logs is ongoing. LE for next steps: 04.01.2024
2023-12-28: [Mikołaj Chyła]: I am getting familiar with this case after taking over from Malgorzata
2023-12-22: [Malgorzata Orda]: No errors found in MCU HWAPI BBB, links are synchronized
2023-12-21: [Krzysztof Gomulec] MCU HWAPI BBB to check data processed and assembled correctly and why TS_MISM issue appeared before DLs and ULs being configured.
2023-12-20 Jia Ying: snapshot is being checked now.
2023-12-19: Mika Kempas: New IN transfer, UP HWAPI AIF analysis is needed
2023-12-19: Jack 2. Peng (NSB) The group in charge changed from RABLTESWPHYDL to BB_PSW_UPHWAPI. Reason for Transfer: IQ data was generated and sent to AIF2 correctly when RF detected no IQ data (Rp3 frame). As next data flow module, DSPHWAPI (murkku) and BB MCUHWPAI to check data processed and assembled correctly and sent to RF side.
2023-12-19 DLPHY: DLPHY IQ data was generated and sent to AIF2 correctly when RF detected no IQ data (Rp3 frame). As next data flow module, DSPHWAPI and MCUHWPAI to check data processed and assembled correctly and sent to RF side.

2024-01-09: Logs from knife delivered, investigation ongoing. Initial check is still not conclusive as there might be still problem with missing prints. Snapshot might be corrupted - still checking.
2024-01-08: Knife provided, if logs will be delivered investigation will be continue..
2024-01-05: [Bank Holiday in Poland] Logs shall be delivered today and investigation will be continued from Monday.
2024-01-04: Kauko Kajula. IR will be tested next night and hopefully results are available on friday morning
2024-01-04 Another pronto attached with same problem, preparing new knife for testing and maybe we can use both test scenarios for reproduction.
2024-01-03 IR responded but looks like no reproduction of original issue but some crash happen. To be check if this is caused by the knife or not.
2024-01-02 IR pending as there was some issue during last test run and need to repeat scenario.IR response shall be ready today.
2023-12-29:Kauko Kajula. Test was running through the night and three issue happened. Unfortunately there was no snapshot taken because one mistake in automatic snapshot configuration. New LE for IR reply is mondat at noon.
2023-12-28. Kauko Kajula: IR will be responded 28.12 afternoon

2024-01-12 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: See the R&D info of internal PR744285. Checked 1.10 logs, the fault 6257 is caused by cplane send 0x269B but MACPS  don't received it. it need CCS team to check it in next step. For 12.25 logs. it seems like with CPlane pronto 03461200, need Cplane experts to confirm it.

2024-01-05 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: Customer don't agree CNN this pronto. and this pronto is attached with pronto PR744285. For PR744285, R&D MACPS try build new knife for detail macps scheduler each step to find which process coast too many time. For this customer pronto, R&D MACPS will continue to check the logs of customer provided, try to find some useful information.
2024-01-04 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: After communicated with customer, they don't agree with CNN. they want to get the final correction together with internal pronto PR744285 before lamadan. next step: Try to persuade customer to CNN this pronto. if not, attach this pronto to PR744285.
2024-01-03 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: Waiting for the local team feedback, per local team estimate, this pronto can be CNN in this week.
2024-01-02 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: Waiting for the Local team feedback, then decide whether this pronto should be closed by CNN firstly.
2023-12-29 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: After change the CPU load control R&D parameter, the crash is not occurred. now Local team need to observe some days.
2023-12-28 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: Waiting for the feedback result after change the CPU load control R&D parameter to 8200
2023-12-27 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: After checked the new logs in 12.25. it confirmed that the crash is caused by high load, and the high load is caused by lots of CA UEs. now advice the local team to change the CPU load control R&D parameter and then observe it few days.
2023-12-26 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: Try to decode the ETB content and check the memory usage unreasonable. Ask Local team to provide the OK logs of other sites which has same parameter with issued sites.
2023-12-25 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: 1) waiting for the new required logs
2) waiting for the test result after change the R&D parameter ERadSwDomainLteMac_TRdDeactveCaUeThr value from 9500 to 9300 or 9000.
2023-12-22 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: 1)Need local team to change the high CPU load threshold from 95% to 93% or 90%, then check whether the crash can not be triggered. 2) Collect the system logs, ttiTrace logs,snapshot logs and KPI log which can cover the crash timing and crash core. 
2023-12-21 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: From the memdump file, it can confirm the issued crash MACPS core has over load, the over load is caused by lots of CA cell configuration and CA UEs. advise local team to modify the load control R&D parameter to trigger the load control in advance or decrease the CA cell configuration.
2023-12-20 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: After checked the MACPS code, it has no finding. as it has no system BTS logs and ttiTrace logs during the crash. now a new IR is trigger to collect the all required logs.
2023-12-19 TDDMAC Hong Feilong: From HWAPI analysis log，this pronto is similar with the pronto 03431356. Based current logs, it still has not find signification information to know what causes the high over load in TDD MACPS.

2023-12-18: Xianming Song: Transfer to L1_SW_5G_UL_PPHY_LAN Assign to to LAN PUCCH team to start Initial analysis: reason for allocation to LAN team: SBTS00 PUCCH issue

2023-12-16 [L2PS_BLR]: L2-PS analysis done, and further analysis need to be continued by L1-UL.
2023-12-16 [L2PS_BLR]: It's clear why is UE discarding/DTX packets in downlink since very first TX itself only decoding is success at the UE with RV=0 but L1 UL decoding that HARQ feedback as DTX even though UE has decoded it correctly. Since gNB L1UL decoding DXT for first TX, L2PS is doing reTX with RV = 2 with same HARQ ID but UE is discarding since it has received same packet in very first TX with RV=0. This seems issue with L1UL HARQ feedback decoding at PUCCH channel for slot 7 for very first Tx.
Will check synchronized UE and gNB logs snippets (If any available sync log) with RNTI and time and share the analysis soon.
2023012-15 [ST_SISO]: Logs gathering ongoing, LE:15.12.2023
2023-12-15 [L2PS_BLR]: We are waiting for almost 2 days to get the needed logs, We will have to move the PR to author group till we get the required logs correctly.
2023-12-14 Michal Szymanski: Specifying the customer impact.
2023-12-14 [L2PS_BLR]: From PassCase L1L2 BIP log, It’s seen that UE is able to decode DL packets and sending correct ACK, but in compared to FailCase L1-UL is not able to decode the PUCCH for few slot, which leads to DL-bler and retransmission.
Will request L1-UL to check further, why It’s not able to decode PUCCH of slot:7,9,17 and reporting DTX for DL-Harq received on those PUCCH slot, which leads to DL-put degradation.
2023-12-13 [L2PS_BLR]: There's approx. 50% DL-Bler and DL-Bler is due DTX, for further debugging additional logs are required, Informed Tester for collecting additional mandatory logs.

Today need further check with tester if test scenario is changed. Ask for retest to see if origin scenario could be reproduced.

[2024-01-09]Wanli Zou: The higher of MSG1 load cause the KPI degreed. And the higher MSG1 load was triggered by ""NR_SR_NO_RESOURCE"" and ""NR_SR_MAX_EXCEEDED"" .
Need involve Viavi  to check what cause the UE has ""NR_SR_NO_RESOURCE "" and ""NR_SR_MAX_EXCEEDED"" .
[2024-01-08] amerilai: UE logs provided
[2024-01-08] The IR was responded on last night, but it seems tester forgot to upload UE log also. We are checking the new IR logs and requesting the associated UE logs as well.
[2024-01-05] amerilai: Pekka Jaakola will support this during the weekend. TL reserved until Saturday for stability, IR to be responded sat/sun depending on workload
[2024-01-05] Wanli Zou: IR is pending on response.
[2024-01-04] amerilai: TL reserved for 23R4 1.0MP stability run. IR will be responded on Monday 8th of January if no weekend support requested.
[2024-01-04][Zou Wanli] Check the IR9 logs. There were no ""SR NO Resource"" logs in this UE logs. And the KPIs of CELL0 and CELL1 did not downgrade. And CELL2 downgrade because of the OVERLOAD. Will ask tester to retest the case with two hours. 
[2024-01-03] amerilai: IR9 responded
[2024-01-03][Zou Wanli] Overload control fix can only fix for cell2. It seems it cannot recover the whole KPI. The main issue of this KPI degradation is on From Max SR/No SR resources, which triggers many rach and consuming CPU. Today need further check. 

[2024-01-02][Zou Wanli] IR responded, analyze the logs today.
[2023-12-30] amerilai: IR8 responded
[2023-12-30] amerilai: IR will be attempted to respond during weekend, but could be delayed due to high top priority workload. LE for this testing is Tuesday 2.1.
[2023-12-29][Zou Wanli] Build 2 knife for 23R4 and 24R1, add counters for recording the all kinds MSG3 failed. IR raised to test the 2 knife.
[2023-12-28][Zou Wanli] Got the Viavi UE logs, check the UE logs and GNB logs.
[2023-12-27][Zou Wanli] This afternoon we will check if tester is working today and if he can provide viavi UE logs on the possible MSG1 sending out statistics on these 3 cells to conclude the root cause.
[2023-12-25][Zou Wanli] Cell0 and Cell1 seems good, Cell2 has a little decreases, which is mainly caused by high MSG1 load.  We don't know the exact reason of this high MSG1 load. Next step: we need Viavi to check the msg1 load(ghost preamble sent too much to gNB?) for the same test case. 
[2023-12-23][Zou Wanli] We are still checking the IR7's logs to find possible clues.
[2023-12-22] amerilai: IR7 responded

[2023-12-20] amerilai: TL currently reserved for 24R1 1.0PD testing. IR will be tested on Friday.
[2023-12-20]  Xu Liyun: Based on the latest knife testing, blocked MSG3 issue was gone. Next step to check the KPI is recover or not.

[2023-12-19] Yin Terry: checking the new logs to figure out why msg3 is blocked, and compare the counter between 24R1 and 23R4 to know the major cause for the kpi degradation.
[2023-12-18] Amerilai: IR responded

2024-01-08 [BOAM_BB_CAPACITY] Illia Aldabaiev: According to the discussion in the Teams chat, corner case related to ""parallel / interlaced processing of multiple pool clean ups"" is a better to handle by extending the design of the L1. So, OAM will only implement sendings of pool clean up requests without any queuing operations.
2024-01-04 [BOAM_BB_CAPACITY] Illia Aldabaiev: Discussion with architects are ongoing.
2024-01-03 [BOAM_BB_CAPACITY] Illia Aldabaiev: Corner case was discussed with Jaroslaw Tolinski. The solution that was adopted earlier coud have problems on system design level due to L1 undefind behavior during parallel handling of pool cleanup requests. Software Architects will decide on which side this corrner case will be handled, due to OoO of some Architecs final solutoin probably will be made next week, what may have an impact on LE.

LE for change will be provided on Friday after internal discussions with TLs.
2023-12-21 Chen Hao: L3 update
STATUS: Second solution discuss meeting is scheduled today, we will continue discussing the solution today.
2023-12-20 Chen Hao: L3 update
STATUS: Several solutions are proposed, no much progress in solution decision. Auto-healing feature CFAM leader(Laurent Thomasson) is involved to comment which solution is preferred and which component is responsible to fix this issue.
2023-12-18 Chen Hao: L3 update
STATUS: RC is known, issue is in a auto-healing feature scenario. I can't comment too much about RC since auto-healing is feature developed by OAM and L1. PR transfer to OAM is rejected with reason ""they are not related"", but it's not true, OAM component is closely involved in solution discuss. We cplane had to lead the solution discuss.
2023-12-15 Chen Hao: L3 update
STATUS: 1) cplane is not involved in auto-healing feature 2) you already find some OAM design defect and potential misunderstanding between OAM and L1 3) current issue investigation is in OAM internal discuss
NEXT STEPS: I will do the PR transfer according the analysis status at my EOB today. If there is no status change, PR will be transferred to OAM because of reason 2 and 3.
SUPPORT NEEDED: Yes
2023-12-14 Chen Hao: L3 update
STATUS: OAM transfer PR to cplane without reasonable analysis for several times. Currently we need L1 to investigate the fault 1811 issue. More details is: 
when DSP is killed, cplane receive L1 poolFailureInd from OAM, according to requirement, cplane need to delete cell. Due to L1 pool failure, cplane will not send celldelete msg to L1, this is designed like this from beginning of cell deletion for several years. Then question to L1 Sami Pekkanen (Nokia) Alessia Puglielli (EXT-Nokia) XianMing Song (Nokia):
1) for L1, should L1 components treat cell is deleted in this situation? 
2) Since DSP is killed by tester, how other L1 components get the info that L1 failure, cell is deleted or DSP killed? Will other L1 components monitor DSP crash? Or will other L1 components wait for external msg notice? For example L1PoolCleanupReq?  
NEXT STEPS: Need L1 to check above questions

2024-01-10 C. Young - added IR331133 for additional debug logs in good/bad case. suspected delay search failure and debug logs might help with troubleshooting

2023-01-02 P. Kaczmarek - summary from teams chat:

When you look at gc prints, power is toggling (going up and down) - so we have no power in one iteration, but is visible again in next. But dpd is stuck in START_ADAPTATION state, because it is seeing some very strange power measurements, like:
model powerMeasurement(): dpdInPowerDbfs=-35.11, dpdOutPowerDbfs=-40.10, fbPowerDbfs=-17.20
^ extreamly high fb comparing to dpdin - it seems those measurements are somehow out of sync
 
here is even worse:
[DPD0] dpd[0_0]: model powerMeasurement(): dpdInPowerDbfs=-60.00, dpdOutPowerDbfs=-60.00, fbPowerDbfs=-41.87
(no tx power at all, fb suggesting some transmission)
Those values do not really seems to be measured correctly.
As a result it leads to raising errorbits, which trigger an alarm in the end.
Those strange measurements START_ADAPTATION needs to be checked from engine perspective.

It seems issue is happening because of super low ssb power configuration.

As wrong  ssbFrequency and freqBandIndicator in MRBTS-7027/NRBTS-7027/NRCELL-2/NRHOIF-1 - not  to be 3GPP compliant.  Why is this not checked during Configuration. See analysis sheet: ECE_DEV_GUL_CP_UE_Analysis_PR741965.docx. Teams Chat exist and SPEC_CP added..
In parallel we still wait from Tester the retest of corrected configuration as suggested , indictaed (now also IR explicit triggered, but was already addressed in Teams Chat on Friday 15.12. (Just for confirmation, but we have Ue log analysis which indicates this wrogn configuration and so we found also Cplane WRN about wrong setting of  ssbFrequency and freqBandIndicator for NRCELL-2/NRHOIF-1 and so Ue gets lost).

2024-01-15 NMucharska [RFSW] Draco need to answer Customer's question when suggested improvement can be implemented. LE: 17.01 Pronto will probably end as CNN on HW team.
2024-01-12 NMucharska [RFSW] Customer care agreed on replacing faulty unit. HW team was asked if they agree on transfer to them
2024-01-11 NMucharska [RFSW] There are 2 ways to proceed with this pronto. 1) SWMAN was asked to send IR to customer as it is possible to reproduce issue with simple reset but it's risky as radio may not recover. 2) Customer will replace faulty radio as per HW team suggestion. We are waiting for answers. 
2024-01-10 NMucharska [RFSW] Draco asked SWMAN to support in answering customer care questions. We also asked HW team if they can investigate case further as it's single unit that is faulty and issue is reapetabile.
2024-01-09 NMucharska [RFSW] CT is asking if we can investigate somehow on OK site. He is OoO until 9th January and also this case has low prio so we will do it as the last priority due to overload of tasks. SWMAN proposed that it is worth to consider the Draco code changing to use popen instead of std::system call to capture tar command output. But it's still proposal when radio will get faulty again. We are still looking for another way.

2023-12-22 NMucharska [RFSW] SWMAN advise is to check RAM memory when issue reappears but it's not possible at the moment. Looking for other ways and teams to investigate. Also SW architect was asked for support.
2023-12-21  NMucharska [RFSW] Waiting for Platform response why file can't be accessed on RMOD but after N-th reset it's visible. Still no answer since Monday. No action on draco now. New person added to the chat. If still no answer, pronto will be transferred.
2023-12-20  NMucharska [RFSW] Waiting for Platform response why file can't be accessed on RMOD but after N-th reset it's visible. Still no answer since yesterday. No action on draco now.
2023-12-19  NMucharska [RFSW] Draco performed simple test within our lab to check the behavior when file is not present. We found two things:
1) file can't be removed from user pov which means it has to be unavailable in other way i.e flash issue or not deployed at all
2) when file can't be accessed we receive same error as in PR
Question is then towards Platform, why file can't be accessed on RMOD but after N-th reset it's visible (1 reset or 6 restes confirmed to solve issue in both PRs). Waiting for their response.

2. ORAN certs needs to be excluded while importing certs to D&RSW else it will lead to additional startup time to copy the entire key storage, TRS Spec needs to confirm this.. Kuldeep Khare (Nokia)
3.  once knife is verified working, bbspec will make the spec changes to the proposed solution.

2024-01-11 S. Räty discussion ongoing in chat
2024-01-10 S. Räty still trying to understand who we need to decide about this change. Asked to have a call.
2024-01-09 S. Räty still under clarification
2024-01-08 Linhai Zhou: The invocation order of api’s setCopyCertificates and importCertificates should be changed . 
As per current design , setCopyCertificate(CB007351) is set to true which will sync keystorage of  fs3 to fs1 and fs2, which overwrites the contents of fs1 and fs2 keystorage.
so with the current design the solution from step 1 will not help as the contents of fs1, fs2 keystorage would be already overwritten.
So first importCertificates should be invoked , followed by the setCopyCertificates set to true. 
SWIM to check
Impacts  on changing the order of api invocation.
2024-01-05 Linhai Zhou: As discussed adding time to whole startup KPI is not possible. because There is constantly pressure by various features to increase the start-up time duration so those all need to be handled carefully
2024-01-04 Linhai Zhou: FDREQ_2629 is a reference REQ.
2024-01-03 S. Räty spec change will be made

2023-12-19: Idriss Cheurfa: Short term solution, L2PS needs to protect itself if needed (as scenario is 2X CP capa). Long term solution for SA only is a improvement on the meas gap allocation algo and a CNI is needed.
2023-12-18: Idriss Cheurfa: Discussion still ongoing, this PR may need CP SPEC side handling.
2023-12-14: Idriss Cheurfa: A&S has proposed to use a bitmap, but L2PS isn't willing to do so. But the issue is more implementation than SPEC, so L2PS should take it back to work on a better implementation solution. No LE yet.

2023-12-11 L2PS MPiech: Attached analysis based on debug knife logs. Measurement gaps timers fulfil almost all limit (for example 255 measGap on timer expiries and 2 expiries of some other timer). Asked L2PS A&S for comments.
2023-12-11 J.Monschau, seems in some slots more than 256 timer expires and it looks those are some kind of  hanging UE, tbc..
2023-12-11 L2PS MPiech: Sent IR with debug knife which should show how many of top 3 timer types expired in single slot.
2023-12-08 L2PS MPiech: As common timer code is involved, L2PS A&S was asked to comment on how to achieve proper solution for excessive timer expiries per slot issue. This would probably require architectural / systemic design decision. Discussion ongoing on issue thread with additional TTI trace findings.
2023-12-07 L2PS MPiech: In NSA case MeasGap configuration is provided by eNB so 4G CP experts requested for comments. On issue thread, there is ongoing discussion about handling excessive timer expiries per slot.
2023-12-06 L2PS MPiech: Requested CR for CPlane to check if observed measurement gap config flow is supported. As clarified SBTS24R1_ENB_0000_000160_000000 logs don't contain crashes because this SW introduced load control improvement for 1 core 2 cell scenario. 
2023-12-05 L2PS MPiech: Investigating UL link adaptation algorithms related to expired timers. Sent IR for retest with R&D params prolonging timers.

2024-01-11 LaurentGuillemot: knife 3 delivery planned for both maintenance branch (first prio) and for Trunk on 20th of Jan, with default configuration grouping by 5RBs. Current knife 3 can be tested for any 4RX and 8Rx test, but wait for Jan 10 for a new knife for the support of 2Rx.
Next step: test knife 3 in 4Rx in FiVe with 5RBs and compare performance with ABIO, and test in PET. FiVe will start testing Jan 11; waiting for estimate from PET teams
2024-01-10 LaurentGuillemot: knife 3 delivery ready for both maintenance branch (first prio) and for Trunk on 20th of Jan, with default configuration grouping by 5RBs. Current knife 3 can be tested for any 4RX and 8Rx test, but wait for Jan 10 for a new knife for the support of 2Rx
Next step: test knife 3 in 4Rx in FiVe with 5RBs and compare performance with ABIO, and test in PET. Waiting for estimate from FiVe and PET teams
2024-01-09 LaurentGuillemot: knife 3 with 5RBs achieved parity with ABIO in Hangzhou lab with 4Rx. Knife 3 is the option selected for customer trial for end of January
Next steps: test knife 3 with grouping up to 3RBs in HZ lab, and request PET testing. L1 SW will deliver the code for 2Rx (Jan 10). Official SW delivery to entity testing LE is Jan 17; After greenlight from all tests, update CFAM and CuDo
2024-01-08 LaurentGuillemot: knife 3 lab results with 5RBs looks wrong. Need to re run tests in HZ lab with 5 RBs and 8RBs and analyze logs
Next steps: test knife 3 in FiVe lab, and continue investigation of knife 1 logs from L2 point of view, why UL PUSCH retransmission of 3 PRBS often shows CRC KO
2024-01-05 LaurentGuillemot: Test knife 3 shows UL performance improvement in Hangzhou lab with wideband interference. Next step: HZ team will test knife 3 with split ARXL jobs by group of 5, and also test merged knife 1 and knife 3. Request sent to FiVe to test knife 3 
2024-01-04 LaurentGuillemot: Test knife 1 does not show much UL performance improvement in Hangzhou lab with wideband interference, but there is no more UL throughput collapse in Espoo FiVe lab. Next step: 5GMAX will analyze logs, and HZ team will compare ABIO with ABIP and knife 1 in same test conditions
2024-01-03 LaurentGuillemot: Test knife 1 with threshold = 30 dB and 20dB in HZ lab with increased interference : up to 10 UES, and moving activity and HO is on going. Expected results tomorrow
2024-01-02 LaurentGuillemot: Both knife 1 and knife 3 provide good results in a test scenario with 2 UEs, and 4 Rx configuration
Knife 1 provides a more accurate pSINR with threshold = 30 dB compared to threshold = 20dB
Knife 3 provides better results with RB grouping 8 or 5 compared to RB grouping = 10
Knife 1 seems to provide more stable results than Knife 3
Knife 1 and knife 3 together would not bring additional improvement : need more testing in a higher interfered environment (up to 10 UEs, moving UEs), and also in FiVe with 8Rx in order to select either knife 1 or knife 3 for solution delivery
Next steps :
. Test knife 1 with with threshold = 30 dB and 20dB in HZ lab with increased interference : up to 10 UES, and moving activity and HO
. Test knife 1 with with threshold = 30 dB and 20dB in FiVE lab with 8Rx
2023-12-29 LaurentGuillemot: Knife 1 (Rdd downscaling with Noise Floor) : Bler improved a lot and almost no obvious t-put drop. Test done with RD parameter highInterfLevel set to 20dB
Next step :
. Test Knife 1 with RD parameter highInterfLevel set to 30dB
. Test knife 3 with RD parameter prbNumPerArxlTask set to default value 10 PRBs
. Test knife 1 in other CIS SSD lab with KT configuration in Hangzhou with 16 UEs
2023-12-28 Chen Feiyan: knife has someting wrong, waiting for new knife.
2023-12-27 LaurentGuillemot: Lab test does not show improvement with and without knife 1 ; IQ data collected
Next step :
1/ Analyse why #knife 1 does not show improvement in lab : verify that R&D parameter highInterfLevel is set to 20, and investigate if L1SW package includes code change, and triggers new algo when INR above 20dB
2/ test the #knife 3 in lab
2023-12-26 wei.6.zhang: tester show knife result don't have any improment, wait for analysis IQ from IQ.
2023-12-25 wei.6.zhang: L1 correction knife  already delivery, wait for verify result :

SBTS00_ENB_9999_231206_1100846
2023-12-25 LaurentGuillemot: Three 5GMax algo improvement options:
#Option1/ Selective Rdd downscaling with Noise floor calculation, using rdParameter to control the interference threshold (default 20dB), good simu results, but under estimation of pSINR
Step1 L1 knife non optimized in C code: delivered, will be tested in CIS SSD HZ lab 25/12
Step2 L1 knife with DSP optimization:  LE  13/01/2024
#Option 2/ RB-Wise (or RB Group wise) Rdd Scaling
Knife with rdParameter to control 5 , 8, 10 RBs and test this option in e2e environment ( PET, ST, FIVE). Adds minor L1 latency. LE for knife : 05/01/2024
#Option 4/ Rdd_Regularization RdHXirc, on top of Option1
5GMax simulations on going shows good results for NB interference up to 50dB. L1 SW will estimate effort
2023-12-22 LaurentGuillemot: from 5GMax simulations, 10RB grouping is not able to fully recover ABIO perf in high MCS. Continue 5GMax simulations with 8 and 5 RB grouping with risks of impact on latency. Continue preparing knifes with Rdd downscaling without and with optimized code, and also with configured RB size grouping
2023-12-21 LaurentGuillemot: Same status for L1 SW knife planning. 5GMax studying additional option using common exponent for Rdd scaler, but further analysis is needed to understand performance of this option vs other discussed solution
2023-12-20 LaurentGuillemot: Knife planning
1/ Selective Rdd downscaling with Noise Floor
Step#1 L1 knife non optimized in C code  :  LE EoF wk51
Step#2 L1 knife with DSP optimization  :  LE  13/01/2024
2/ RB-Wise (or RB Group wise) Rdd Scaling
Knife with RAD Parameter to control 5 , 8, 10 RBs and test this option in e2e environment ( PET, ST, FIVE). LE for knife : 05 / 01/ 2024
2023-12-19 LaurentGuillemot: Simulation from design is that RB grouping equal 10 is doable from latency perspective, but RB grouping equal 1 is not acceptable.
Next step:
. L1 Knife Rdd downscaling step1 with C-code : LE EoF wk51
. L1 knife with RAD Parameter to control 5 , 8, 10 RBs grouping in order to be tested in PET , ST Korean CCS lab & Five : LE 24 wk 1.2
. Prepare 5GMAX simulation with both Rdd downscaling and RBs grouping to check if both options combined together bring benefits
2023-12-18 LaurentGuillemot: Rdd downscaling with Noise Floor : new knives in preparation with improved Thermal Noise measurement and high interference clipping. L1 Knife step1 with C-code : LE EoF wk51; L1 knife step2 with optimized DSP code LE mid Jan (3 weeks after step1)
Next step: 5GMAX studying additional RB Group wise Rdd Scaling improvement, including impact on UCI on PUSCH, and L1 Arch checking capacity impact. 5GMAX Rdd regularization study as alternative option of Rdd downscaling has a lower priority  
2023-12-15 LaurentGuillemot: Request to L1 SW to prepare a new L1 knife with SINR clipping on top of current knife. Estimate will be provided by L1 Friday Dec 15
Next step: 5GMAX studying 3 options in parallel : selective Rdd downscaling with Noise Floor, RB Group wise Rdd Scaling, and Rdd regularization : 5GMax simulation on going,  L1 Arch checking capacity impact
2023-12-14 LaurentGuillemot: L1 knife with measured noise planned to test in FiVe: LE this week
Next step: Selective Rdd downscaling with Noise Floor, RB-Wise (or RB Group wise) Rdd Scaling, Rdd regularization : 5GMax simulation on going,  L1 Arch checking capacity impact
2023-12-13 LaurentGuillemot: L1 knife test result on CIS SSD container : not conclusive as high INR was not observed in the test run. It is planned to test the knife also in FiVe
Next step:
. 5G Max works on a solution to improve Thermal Noise estimation under INR  above 45dB
. RB wise Rdd scaling
. Rdd regularization
2023-12-12 LaurentGuillemot: L1 knife with measured Noise Floor : optimization of RDD scaling based on real noise estimation Ready for testing in Hangzhou CIS SSD container LE. 12.12 and Espoo FiVe LE. 13.12
2023-12-11 Charles: waiting TF meeting result and test result of algorithm change knife. LE. 11.12
2023-12-10 PiotrDelegacz: Tests are still ongoing. Next steps to be defined on Monday - 11.12.2023. 2023-12-09 PiotrDelegacz: In the last Friday, the knife of the algorithm change has been delivered to tester. Tester will arrange the testing in the weekend. There is no TF meeting planned in the weekend. L1 A&S team invited the TF meeting from next Monday. 
2023-12-22 LaurentGuillemot: same status; 5GMAX results expected next year
2023-12-15 LaurentGuillemot: same status; 5GMAX results expected next year
2023-12-8 LaurentGuillemot: same status; 5GMAX results expected next year
2023 December LaurentGuillemot: Big 5GMAX simulations effort; it will probably take several weeks/months to have a solution. This issue has been detected since July
Next step: expectation is to have a 5GMAX sub optimal algo proposal for Rdd downscaling beginning of next year. A first knife to workaround the issue is expected to be ready before end of year. After testing it at Five and the PR741526 test setup, picture will be cleaner IF we get a path to workaround it.
On most cell with low volume of INR below 35db the current algorithm will provide the best KPI and any workaround shall only be enable on cell showing high volume of INR above 35dB.
2023-12-05 LaurentGuillemot: when the NB interference input exceeds 35dB, ABIP exhibits lower robustness compared to ABIO, leading to degradation in some KPIs (e.g., iBLER/rBLER, Tput)
Next step: 5GMAX investigating on selective Rdd downscaling with measured Noise Floor with target a solution for 24R1 P8","known","SBTS24R1 2024-01-22, SBTS00 2024-01-22","[object Object], [object Object]","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/qc/?prontos=%22PR741526%22"",""2"")","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/qc/?all_prontos=%22PR741526%22"",""2"")","0",0,,41,"Investigating","SBTS24R1","3 - Normal","Permanent","B - Major","TOP1_24R1-SR_3.0PD, TOP1_24R1-SR_ST_ABIP","CR1462387 | SBTS24R1 | LE: 2024-01-22 | SBTS24R1_ENB_0000_xxx_yyy | Correcting | , CR1468793 | SBTS00 | LE: 2024-01-22 | SBTS00_ENB_9999_xxx_yyy | Correcting | ","TOP1_24R1-SR_3.0PD, TOP1_24R1-SR_ST_ABIP, TOP2_24R2-SR_ST","Feiyan Chen (NSB)","CIS_SSD_EAST_1_HZ_4","Yi 2.

Main hypothesis that BMU changes in 23R3 could have introduced this issue not valid anymore, as  original issue observed after test with software containing old BMU software part (from 23R2) .
From SW point of view no additional findings except conclusion that probably clock is not the only common function between SRIO and Ethernet card. Power supply is common too, but here is no way for SW to understand if malfunctioning of power supply is the issue.
Due to it will start  simultaneous HW investigation. Method of shipping faulty HW board to the Finland HW R&D Lab under recognition;

2024-01-15 S. Räty We see following options:
1. Dynamically reduce traffic when buffer fill levels get critical: CNI for a concept was requested from Kai, but is obviously not yet started. A concept for measuring the queue fill level on driver side is available, but not yet implemented.
2. Statically reduce traffic by switching off traces or other traffic.
3. Optimize runtime distribution between cores to offload core0 runtime. This is needs alignment between several baseband SW architects.

2023-12-20 Victor Morales Cayuela: There are some inconsistencies in specification regarding the mutual compatibility between A2 Redirection and other MeasObjects. Correction is halted until this has been clarified.
2023-12-20 Victor Morales Cayuela: First correction for Inter-RAT NG handover (SCellAddition branch) has been already submitted to master and second correction (non-SCellAddition branch) has been successfully tested with a knife. I will proceed with the corrections for Intra-RAT NG handover and Xn handover.

there are 2 ways to address it:
Update DoPR to match current standards and PDL implementation which is the desired one (i.e. has activation flag as part of parameter) 
OR
Update PDL to match current DoPR. i.e. remove activation flag from PDL rules

2024-01-05: Idriss Cheurfa: This PDL rule is too complex with little benefit (CuDo clearly state the limitation and the rules). From experts POV this is not need. CNN candidate. Discussion with tester is still not concluding.
2024-01-04: Idriss Cheurfa: CNN candidate, contacted tester, waiting for approval. 04/01.
2024-01-03 Arto Paavola: CNN candidate. NIDD update is not possible due to Object Modelling guidelines (all children need to have identical MOC and parameter definitions). On the other hand, LTE3639 CuDo is OK, as it states validation is done only if feature has been activated and otherwise parameter iqStreamId is ignored. CuDo chapter ""LTE3639 configuration recommendations"": ""Changing the I/Q Data Stream identifier (iqStreamId) parameter values while the feature is deactivated does not generate any result, as the parameter is not taken into account.""

[12.12.2023] LJackowski: Fault severity for FEC corrected codewords errors will be decrease to warning. Correction under preparation. LE for SFS: 15.12.2023
ASIA TFL : Charles Yan (NSB) TBD
EU TFL: Alona Kulieshova (Nokia) 
1. Issue impact: All FEC errors were of the corrected type, KPIs were good, so we've concluded there is no service impact for this issue.
2. Increase in M11: No evidence of a functional change in M11. Historical data shows a pattern of increasing FID4741 following upgrades, then returning to baseline levels. That appears to be happening here. We plan to test this theory by rolling back some sites which is in active alarm state and see if FID4741 continues. 
3. What to do about sites with  FID4741? We are hesitant to push customer on taking action with these as there is no service impact and the effort is costly.
We did compare a good link versus a faulty link. A good link has less than 50 FEC errors per minute (often 0) while a faulty link has more than 3000 FEC errors per minute with the fault raised, dropping in the 1000-2000 range when the fault is not raised.
4. Future FID4741 improvements: Feedback from Hassan is that this issue is very problematic as the fault is a major which triggers a lot of activity with TMO. We can't have these major alarms occurring frequently with no action to be taken
CNI-115490 will introduce configurable thresholds for FID4741 which may allow TMO to configure the feature so that it is useful. We may also need to consider splitting FID4741 into separate alarms, with different severities for the different flavors. Adding Dinesh K. Sharma (Nokia) to give a heads up that TMO may be looking for changes to the way FID4741 works.

2023-12-011 Decheng Fu [RFSW]: no alarm raised on new upgrade site. waiting the next step from FOTL and CIS team. nothing can do from Pre-inv side.
2023-12-08 ImanMasjedi [RFSW]: IR raised to change the SFP and cable. No LE provided by customer care . TF attached. Waiting for RAN System PdM Operability decision to downgrade the FID4741 (corrected FEC) to minor as there's no service impact; Site is scheduled to be upgraded to 23R4 E11 tomorrow night to see if the FID4741 reoccurred.
2023-12-07 ImanMasjedi [RFSW]: IR raised to change the SFP and cable. No LE provided by customer care . TF attached. 
It is confirmed that this is no longer a 23R4 GA blocker and no SW changes are expected in 23R4. But the view is that this is still a defect as we should not have major alarms for conditions with no service impact. There is plan to meet 11/12 when Stefan Guzik is back.
2023-12-06 AlonaKulieshova [RFSW]: IR raised to change the SFP and cable. No LE provided by customer care . TF attached. we are waiting on customer feedback, so we don't know yet if they want a SW changes for FID4741 (to check the possibility with Stefan Gugik to split FID4741 alarm according to its reason and eliminate 4741 for corrected FEC errors)
2023-12-05 ImanMasjedi [RFSW]: daily TF is ongoing ,IR raised ,waiting to IR response. 
2023-12-04 AlonaKulieshova[RFSW]: request for customer:
1. Check physical fronthaul cable link and its components.
2. If it doesn't work, replace SFPs and fiber.

2023-12-06 HelmutK: proposed config change not possible - now srPeriodicity = 40 slots applied on live site. 
2023-12-05 HelmutK: L2PS implementation for double-decoding: only update the DTX counter once if both Pucch are DTX.  Next step: filter correctly those double-Pucch in TTI trace to get better view of DTX statistics / which Pucch are really failing.
Requested to re-test with actAdaptiveSr=False and NRBTS/NRCELL/srPeriodicity = 10 slots (should be same as current setting TRUE and 80 slots on TDD.
2023-12-04 HelmutK: There is also a case when PUCCH F1 carries both HarqA/N and SR, then there will be 2 PUCCH Requests (blind detection: DTX in the PUCCH in SR vs Harq region (PRB/cyclicShift/OCC) means positive vs negative SR) -- so there will always be a DTX for the pair.

We're considering possible approaches to solve this problem that would not have too big of an impact on the whole architecture.

2023-12-11 RF-FPGA: Set up a testing environment similar to CMCC in the Nanjing Lab, where eNB was synchronized to gNB through bakcplane mode and APHG knife was run on it. Up to now, APHG 4G cells have been working stably for 45 hours. The CPRI RX user clock (eNB) and CPRI TX user clock (gNB) do not appear to have significant differences(only 16ns difference, may caused by CDC, since it was also 16ns difference when 4G cells were first created), indicating that there may be no frequency difference. Till now there are evidnecs as attached APGH analysis  to prove that the cell sleeping is not related to APHG FPGA. So transfer this PR back to last GIC.

2023-12-07 RF-FPGA: RFSW and BBU knife is ongoing.
2023-12-06 RF-FPGA: RF FPGA debug image has provided  to RF-RTSP team, and next step RF-RTSP and RFSW will help to build BBU knife, it may be ready tomorrow.
2023-12-05 RF-FPGA: Co-work with BBU team which may be responsible for clock synchronization in LTE BBU side. Supect that there is small frequency difference between eNB and gNB.
2023-12-04 RF-FPGA: APHG FPGA debug knife is still ongoing.
2023-12-02 RF-FPGA: Although Asir HUB is connected to both gNB (5G eCPRI BBU) and eNB (4G CPRI BBU), there is only one clock chip on Asir HUB, which can only synchronize to gNB (5G PTP priority). The reference clock used by Asir HUB TX to send data to eNB RX is on the same frequency as gNB. The clock and data recovered by eNB RX from the receiving link are of the same origin as gNB. eNB ultimately needs to process the recovered data using the local clock. If there is a frequency difference between the recovery clock of eNB and the local clock of eNB, So it is possible that data may drift out of the window over a long period of time, leading to sleep problems. So Asir FPGA team plan to do a knife to check whether the frequency differences exist.

2023-12-04 Leka RX: Last Friday Leka RX prepared few TVs with correct configuration, but encountered some problems with simulation environment. Finally after some manual changes in TV we managed to reproduce the issue in simulation on Leka LVL. For now it has been confirmed that the problem is visible in PUSCH IP - we are still reviewing the problematic subcomponent. 
Next Step: Based on insights from current investigation we'll try to prepare TV which reproduce the issue on PUSCH simulation level. LE: 12-06
2023-12-01 Leka RX: Simulation is passing with first version of TV's, however many parameters in PUSCH config are inconsistent between RX Capture and TV -  fixing these parameters, generate new TV and start simulation again. Simulation Result LE: Monday Morning.
2023-11-30 Leka RX: Generated first version of TV. Currently trying to run functional simulation on PUSCH LVL. le: 12-01
2023-11-29 Leka RX: PUSCH and PUCCHF01 prbs are overlapped,  L2PS provided solution doesn't fix the issue in Corner case PR737954. TV creation still ongoing struggling with rxcapture to GE tool, but now it seems to be working correctly - New LE for TV creation: 11-30
2023-11-28 TKiviahde: Issue seen first time in unreleased SW SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_000861_000007 build but issue seen also in 23R4 0.1MP candidate build SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_000861_000013 
2023-11-28 Leka RX: high frequency happened stuck issue, there are 135 times stuck during 48h stability test. New logs provided from the path in different snapshots collected in the run mentioned before. 
New occurrence checked, it seems that the issue is identical, First suspicious in PUSCH IP - DMRS subblock, as without simulation reproduction it would be very difficult to identify.

2024-01-12 [ST SISO] J. Grzelak - Weekend support requested. Will be provided if test will be able to finish before GMB. If not, RFT build will be tested on Monday.
2024-01-11 [DCS] Meredith Xu: CI passed. Wait xL24R1 unlock.

2024-01-08 [DCS] Meredith Xu: Try to use solution that sort ulcomp cells by bandwith instead of index.
2024-01-05 [DCS] Meredith Xu: Still discussing with TL to find solution.
2024-01-04 [ST SISO] K. Botkowska - weekend support not requested. 05.01 is day off in Poland, so no tester support provided.
2024-01-04 [DCS] Meredith Xu: Investigation ongoing.
2024-01-03 [DCS] Meredith Xu: Start to check.
2024-01-02 [DCS] Wenpu Xu: There are still some issues about this pronto during finding solution. After UPD allocated the path for all channels successfully, the BBCONF is still failed and needs to rediscuss with BBCONF.
2023-12-29 [ST SISO] J. Grzelak - weekend support not requested
2023-12-27 [DCS] Wenpu Xu: The original solution may still have issues, after discussing with TL, debug to find a new solution.
2023-12-25 [DCS] Wenpu Xu: The solution about limitting the cells on two ABIAs backplane routing each other is useful. But there is lacking some requirement about the solution. It needs to confirm with BBCONF spec. Another solution about limitting the one RP3 link routing each other is not useful. It's
also need to disscuss with BBCONF whether this solution is unreasonable.
2023-12-22 [ST SISO] K. Botkowska LE for draft code about the possible solutions is 12.25, so I assume that weekend support is not needed. 25-26.12 no support as days off in Poland.

2023-12-21 [DCS] Wenpu Xu: A possible solution was proposed and need to  verify this solution in local.
2023-12-20 [DCS] Wenpu Xu: This is a complex case, and the solution is still under investigation.
2023-12-19 [DCS] Wenpu Xu: Take this pronto from B.Gebura and check the issue scenario to find solution

The test was executed 270 times (= 270 carrier re-activations), but the issue didn't come visible. It was concluded that the changes of the L1 Low SOC SW have improved the timing setup.
Next Action: It was discussed and agreed that  Jouni Raisanen (Nokia) will re-run the test case for
Knife #2 WA: Increase number of frames for waiting window from 2 (to 3?) in L1 Low DL carrier start-up sequences
Test result: 300x execution without any issues. It might be that Interrupt logging functionality can be kept untouched in L1 Low SoC SW.
Knife #1 WA: Remove all SoC L1 Low interrupts from SoC SW logs
The tests to be completed by Jan 5th, morning EET


2024-01-04 AM: Provided a tryout knife: Remove kernel logs from critical sections + wait_window_frames = 3 under test. It's expected that the issue can't be reproduced within the L1 Low SoC SW knife (#31907). It seems that the interrupt log writing of L1 Low SoC SW code is always affecting to Mars SoC timing and selection of the frame number (= N1) in the start-up procedure of the carrier. It doesn't matter whether the log writings have been enabled or disabled. It was concluded that there are two alternatives to correct the issue:
Alt1: Remove the interrupt log writings from the first PR680027 WA procedure of L1 Low SoC SW.
Note: This will be implemented as a L1 Low SoC SW correction for SRM7 23R4 (Branch).
Alt2: Combine PR680027 WA procedures (the first and the second) of L1 Low SoC SW. Re-factor the code and remove Mars ES1 specific handling from the code.
Note: This will be implemented as a L1 Low SoC SW correction for SRM7 Trunk (Master).
No updates from SoC Validation team so far. However, it would be important to get a suitable Mars SoC test bench and reproduce the issue on the SoC test bench without RF SW.
Next actions:
Need to create two new separate L1 Low SoC SW knives (on top of SRM7 Trunk) for following changes: Problem #1: Too many log writing for SoC L1 Low interrupts, Knife #1 WA: Remove all SoC L1 Low interrupts from SoC SW logs. Problem #2: Illegal N1 time value might be used for setup of new DL carrier after downlink carrier deletion, Knife #2 WA: Increase number of frames for waiting window from 2 (to 3?) in L1 Low DL carrier start-up sequences. Try to re-procedure the issue with the combined L1 Low SoC SW knife (RF SW Knifer #31907) until EOB Wednesday. Need to find suitable Mars SoC test bench for this issue from SoC Validation side. This requires a 50G Ethernet tester.

2024-01-03 AM: Creates a new L1 Low SoC SW knife (on top of SRM7 Trunk) that contains both changes: Problem #1: Too many log writing for SoC L1 Low interrupts. WA: Remove all SoC L1 Low interrupts from SoC SW logs. Problem #2: Illegal N1 time value might be used for setup of new DL carrier after downlink carrier deletion. WA: Increase number of frames for waiting window from 2 (to 3?) in L1 Low DL carrier start-up sequences.
Need to find suitable Mars SoC test bench for this issue from SoC Validation side to re-procedure the issue with the newest  L1 Low SoC SW knife.
2024-01-02 AM: suspected that this issue (PR740055) and earlier PR680027 issue are linked to each other. Usage of incorrect N1 time value might be the root cause. Earlier WA of PR680027 might not fully solve the issue. Patrik Broms (Nokia) and Jarno Jakonen (Nokia) know the best details of earlier WA, they are on vacation until today. need to create a new L1 Low SoC SW knife for Problem #1: Too many log writing for SoC L1 Low interrupts- WA: Remove all SoC L1 Low interrupts from SoC SW logs
Problem #2: Illegal N1 time value might be used for setup of new DL carrier after downlink carrier deletion. WA: Change number of frames for waiting window from 2 to 3 in L1 Low carrier start-up sequence. Igor to discuss with Jari Tuliniemi about SoC Validation testing capacity and Mars test board availability to support testing of this issue. Jouni Raisanen (Nokia) has other more urgent issues to be tested on his test line.

2023-12-28 SPu: Test knife within following details:
http://janusz.emea.nsn-net.net:8080/job/DEV_small_knifer/31637/
""PR740055: Add checkIfCarrierStarted to 23R4 + l1low application + RF.SRM7.23R4.20231221.002""
 The knife contains ""checkIfCarrierStarted "" functionality of L1 Low SoC SW for 23R4 branch. It also contains DPD SoC SW fixes on-top of the build.
Verifying the knife with build #1016 of SRM7 23R4 branch until the issue is re-produced or next (Thu) morning when we have TF follow-up meeting. Let's see which one comes the first.
2023-12-27 SPu: Issues with knife creation, Knife build failed for multiple DPD-errors. Investigating.
2023-12-22 AM:  Debcon is not crashing anymore after Debcon time stamps were written to ARM STM logs. He hasn't been able to re-produce the issue after he started to use L1 Low Debcon for Mars SoC log collection. The test case was executed over 200 times so there is no point to repeat it within the same setup and settings. TF team concluded that usage of Debcon is causing an additional delay that gives enough waiting time for L1 Low SoC HW and SW to complete setup of carrier configurations. We need to take one step back and try to re-produce the issue without Debcon.
Somebody from RF L1 Low application SW team must create a knife on top of 23R4 branch SW package that Jouni is using. The knife needs to contain the L1 Low SoC SW fix that has been created and exists for Trunk. The fix is the dynamic waiting method of L1 Low SoC SW for situation where carrier activations are not yet completed.
Next steps forward: continues testing with his testing scenario on the same test line without usage of Debcon. New test results and logs are expected to be available soon.

Next TF follow-up meeting will be held on need basis.

2023-12-22 AM: Commented that Debcon HW has known internal memory bugs that lead crash of all Mars SoCs in the RF unit. This is preventing the log collection for this testing scenario. This is something that should be considered to be fixed into Rautu SoC HW design before IP5 and Tape Out milestones. Mercury SoC will have a completely new approach and design for SoC log collection. introduced a new idea for the log collection:
Configure Debcon to use ARM STM logs instead of Debcon's internal memory. The settings can be changed with def_mem commands. However, BCN time stamps are not complete because only 16bit of memory is used for each time stamp but data of BCN time stamps are longer than 16bit.
Next step: Provide instructions to configure Debcon to use ARM STM logs instead Debcon's internal memory. SoC Lab continues testing with the testing scenario on the same test line with edited Debcon configuration. New test results and logs are expected to be available during afternoon today.
In SoC lab verifies the L1 Low application SW workaround after Debcon logs are successfully collected and analysed.

2023-12-21 AM: The IR is responded as issue was not reproduced. New IR created which contains usage and instructions for DEBCON log collection of the issue. In the SoC lab re-produced the failure, after cell has blocked and unblocked. In SoC lab continues testing with testing scenario on the same test line. Waiting for testing results.
2023-12-20 AM: Waiting for IR response. Also tried to reproduced the issue in the SoC Lab.
2023-12-19 AM: Waiting for IR response. new method for catching the fault is shared to be tested. 
2023-12-18 AM: Waiting for IR response. Tests were running the whole weekend. No reproduction of this issue within ~50 hours of testing.
2023-12-16 AM: Waiting for IR response. Issue was not reproduced during 5 rounds of testing with full PIT content. will continue testing until issue will be reproduced.
2023-12-15 AM: Waiting for IR response. First TF is arranged for today. 
2023-12-14 AM: the Top1 priority is asked to be changed to lower Top. Reasoning is that the occurrence rate low. It's single occurrence still. 1/14 in CIT runs
2023-12-14 AM: have been investigating the logs but haven't found anything useful yet, so here's few next steps for today: Debug knife for resetting the debug BCN register from DLDIF during carrier enable to ensure that the DEBUG_DATA_BCN_LO value is updated to register dumps.
Configuration set for DEBCON tool and try to catch failing testrun to the DEBCON dump
IR is created and waiting for IR response.
2023-12-13 AM: SoC did some investigation and it seems that when the DLDIF underflow happens there is something curious in the BCN times:  START_N2_LO[24] = 0xd6baf9e5 and DEBUG_DATA_BCN_LO[24] = 0x75ba898b
Looks like DLDIF receives data in frame 0x75 but the configured starting frame is 0xd6 i.e. there is a huge difference which is not visible in the OK cases. In OK cases the frame seem to match. Not sure if this means anything though, have to continue investigation on Wednesday.
2023-12-12 Laihiainen: [L1low] L1low Mars analysis to be added
2023-12-12 AM:  PR is transferred to SoC without analysis. Need to find FA for it.
2023-12-11 Laihiainen: [L1low] Mars side investigation ongoing. Questions open for SoC

2023-12-04 MKrawczynski [RFSW] suspect that NR1900.TX_1_1000_3645 antenna 1 is dead. Either L1low is not transmitting anything there or it's broken somewhere inside of DFE. Draco team needs to check this case further
2023-12-01 Szczepkowicz: New correction form added SBTS23R4 0.2MP after branch out
2023-11-30 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Additional recommendations from SoC team : ""try to test with artificial load on (or then send traffic towards UE) and gather the logs from there so we would have proper power levels on DFE. Also one thing that could be checked would be data captures from DFE, also preferrably with artificial load or real traffic turned on""
IR will be updated
2023-11-29 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Waiting for the IR response to confirm if this issue is related to faulty radio.
HW analysis: ""particular pipe (antenna2a) is indeed in OpenLoop state from GC point of view but that is because the power level is so low that it goes below our limits for GC operation and also DPD doesn't get proper data for adaptation. I would assume this is because only SSB and rarely some CSI-RS is sent so in time domain we have very rarely any data. The FB powers in that pipe seem to be still in OK level compared to the very low TX power levels.""
2023-11-28 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Waiting for the IR response to confirm if this issue is related to faulty radio. HW team involved in the chat to check the case in the meantime
2023-11-27 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Analysis attached, we suspect some HW problem here. IR will raised to check that

[#RC: unknown][#Investigation analysis LE: 2023-11-29]
2023-11-27 RonJameson: After reviewing the logs and the code (and discussing findings with Tommy Perry) we have concluded that the current implementation in Alps (for Martian) does not align with the test expectations (which seem to align to the Alarm Handling requirements tied to Yoda). In short, the test is short circuiting the DC voltage for 29 minutes, but the Alps SW is raising the alarm after 16 seconds (and also disabling the supply and stopping all monitoring). So the recovery only lasts 16 seconds total, but the test expects continued recovery up to (but not including) 30 min. Tommy and I discussed this and there are a couple of specification issues: 1) The AHS does not currently show this alarm to be applicable to Martian (should it be?). 2) The Martian HW-SW procedures to not specify this current behavior (or any behavior related to the pgood monitoring for this supply). And as I mentioned before, the test case (and Alps Tester code) aligns with the recovery procedure currently specified for Yoda (in the 7.1 LF HW SW Procedures), but the Alps implementation actually does not align with this. So the question is: What should the specified behavior be for Martian in this case?

2024-01-10 FC: New IR is created with new configuration suggestion. The purpose is to resolve PDCCH blocking. Waiting for test result.  DPA problem is under discussion with CP colleague
2023-01-08 : L2-PS Analysis - We are back to 11/2023 about the point raised at this time about no Specific Requirement was given by Test Team and Spec/Perf&Capa to check the feasibility of the test under the configuration conditions.
2023-01-08 : Jens will be back today, will request to prioritize this case. 
2023-01-05 : L2-PS Analysis - The issue seen on the PR Description and first analysis done in November 2023 is not visible in the log provided today.
2023-01-05 : Tester has refused the close the pronto with only CP correction as from test pov RC is still not fixed. We need to pursue investigation on why wlot utilization is low. As per A&S discussion with Jing Wu this needs to be checked by L2-PS SW. We will attach analysis and move case to L2-PS SW.
2024-01-04 : In the internal A&S meeting it was suggested to close PR with CP correction and raise a new PR for scheduling issue, however from tester pov original issue still exists so closing this PR with CP correction is rejected. Next steps are in UP domain, waiting for next action. 
2024-01-03 : Correction has been failed, Jens Gerbert is back on 8th Jan. Most likely case has to wait for Jens. Meanwhile we are checking with Kris Bakowski if he can help in this case.

2023-11-24] F. Djebbari L2PS: 
1. L2PS works as designed 
2. The drop seen in SA UE TP is caused by limitation in PxCCH resources which results in PDCCH blocks at cs1 & cs2 level.
3. These algorithms have not  changed.
[Next Step]
1.	No specific requirement was given by test team.
2.	Spec/perf&capa to check the feasibility of the test under the configuration conditions.

2024-01-12 Hartmut Feile: PR739107 requires an SFS update followed by an L2PS software implementation.  In the chat, A&S provided a very first draft of a proposal on how to address this issue.  The discussion on this proposal is ongoing.  No LE can be given so far.
2024-01-11 Hartmut Feile: New transfer to A&S L2RT.  PR739107 was assigned to the related A&S slicing expert.
2024-01-11 Rajchel Jan [L2-PS]IR was responded. In slots with 100% utilization there is an issue with conversion rbg to prb. Same topic is under discussion with A&S - the proper way of conversion needs to be find, as original method does not properly take into consideration multiple BWP scenarios.

2024-01-03 Grzegorz Gackowski [L2-PS] Created possible correction knife to fix PS BWP related issues connected to RBG - PRB conversion. IR sent.
2024-01-02 Piotr Warmke [L2-PS] Looks like issue occurs also in slots in which there is no PS BWP used, however it still looks like it is connected with wrong RBG - PRB conversion (likely because last RBG is handled in wrong way).
2023-12-29 Piotr Warmke [L2-PS] Looks like invalid SAS metrics are calculated in slots when Power Saving BWP is used by any UE, it happens due to invalid RBG to PRB conversion. Different BWPs may have different RBG sizes, however L2-PS assumes it is the same for all BWPs which is wrong. Apart from that, need check with A&S if this is OK that different UEs are passed to SAS WRR than FDM WRR.
2023-12-28 Piotr Warmke [L2-PS] Issue was reproduced in SCTs, investigating why in slots when PS BWP is used there is more RBGs distributed than available.
2023-12-27 Grzegorz Gackowski [L2-PS] Issue from the latest logs was also successfully reproduced in SCT. SAS Round Robin is distributing more RBGs than available for distribution. Search for the root cause ongoing.

2023-12-04 According to debug knife, the exceeeding avg shares are calculated due to instant shares which are also above 100% if they would be rounded. The next point of investigation is to check Inst High/Low calculation and other related variables used in calculation PRB in DRB

SUPPORT NEEDED: No.
2024-01-08 L3 [KMS]: HZH team is working on the fix
2024-01-04 L3: [miliszcz]: commit causing hanging UEs identified and confirmed in both PET and SCT reproduction
2024-01-03 L3: [miliszcz]: knife with revert tests ongoing, no hangups so far, DEV is analyzing SHB logs
2024-01-02 L3: [miliszcz]: knife (with suspicious commit reverted) provided for testing to check for the root cause
2023-12-29 L3: [miliszcz]: one build confirmed OK. Four builds with suspicious commits scheduled for automated tests in jenkins.
2023-12-28 L3: [miliszcz]: commits from search range analyzed, few that could potentially introduce the root-cause selected for further tests, knives prepared, IR opened.
2023-12-27 L3: [miliszcz]: binary search over the weekend provided two OK builds, more tests are ongoing,  about 300 CPRT commits to analyze, analysis in progress
2023-12-22 L3: [miliszcz]: binary search progressing in PET; DEV SCT reproduction still in progress, no successful so far.
2023-12-21 L3: [miliszcz]: debug knife tests aborted in favor of binary search; requested to increase SHB runtime size to 50MB; cause narrowed to builds 230613 (OK) and 230811 (NOK)
2023-12-20 L3: [miliszcz]: not related to PR738290. Similar or same hanging resource issue reproduced with lates IR328820. Analyzing new logs (some more INF/WRN visible comparing to previous tests).
2023-12-19 L3: [miliszcz]: new IR opened to check potential relation to PR738290 (test with correction and first faulty build)
2023-12-18 L3: [miliszcz]: hanging HO SRC ctx issue not reproduced during weekend run with debug knife; requested to continue testing with rlpDetCsiBsiThreshold=75 to avoid false positives
2023-12-14 L3: [miliszcz]: issue not reproduced in the last IR run, running again; debug knife in preparation
2023-12-13 L3: [miliszcz]: log analysis from IR328111 is ongoing. Syslog overload is still visible.
2023-12-12 L3: [miliszcz]: 2nd knife run not finished but no reproduction so far. Asked for a retest with new swconfig.txt flags.
2023-12-11 L3: [miliszcz]: Waiting for 2nd knife results, still no successful reproduction in SCT.
2023-12-08 L3 [KMS]: First knife tested, issue not reproduced. Due to stabi testing planned for a weekend, second knife will be tested in early next week.
2023-12-07 L3: [miliszcz]: Waiting for IR result, working on SCT reproduction.
2023-12-07 V.Sipola: We have 24R1 stability run ongoing that will be finished later today. After that we can start IR testing.
2023-12-06 L3: IR raised yesterday, waiting for response
2023-12-04 L3: SCT with reproduction in progress - LE: Thursday 23-12-07. Investigation ongoing.
2023-12-01 L3: Investigation still ongoing. Possible problem with state machine in Intra-DU HO functionality on CP-RT component. Trying to reproduce failling scenario in SCT test. LE for SCT will be defined on Monday, 4th December
2023-11-30 L3: Faulty scenario was identified as intra gnb intra du inter cell handover. Investigation ongoing to find a root cause.
2023-11-27 L3 [KMS]: Investigation still ongoing, main contributor found (fixed under PR737837), L3 analysis continues on remaining part
SBTS24R1 Correction form created base build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007)
2023-11-24 F. Crouzy (L2PS) There is no gNB resource hanging, remaining UE is kept alive due to rlpDetCsiBsiThreshold=10000. Few L1 fake CSI detection is enough to prevent UL RLF.
L2ps recommendation is to use A&S recommended value ""75"".
Next step : test again with rlpDetCsiBsiThreshold=75, if there is no hanging UE anymore, PR will be closed as CNN.
2023-11-24:NPhlek: Issue still not reproduced after over night run, tested with SBTS00_ENB_9999_231117_000016.
2023-11-23 F.Crouzy (L2PS) : Waiting IR results
2023-11-22 F. Ribert (L2PS) Results of IR including fix of PR737837 show better results : all UEs are deleted in a short time except 1. Unfortunately in the snapshot of IR, TTI traces are corrupted. New IR to retest with ENB_9999_231117_000016 and retrieve syslogs, snapshot and TTI traces starting just before UE releases
2023-11-22. PO - Investigation started.
2023-11-21 BKopacz [CP] L2Hi doesn't report inactivity for the problematic UEs. Asked L2Hi to comment, ale an Ir raised to check a possible connection with PR737837
2023-11-21 V.Sipola: IR testing with SBTS00_ENB_9999_231117_000016 started, result available tomorrow morning.
2023-11-21 BKopacz [CP] Assignement done
2023-11-20 F.Ribert (L2PS) Active UEs are still visible in all components L2PS, L2LO and L2HI 20 minutes after the end of traffic.
Metrics set in Resource Usage data sent by L2PS to CPlane are consistent and match with other indicators of number of active UEs visible in all components.
This means that some UEs did not start any deletion procedure despite long inactivity time.
Next Step : As UE deletion procedure is triggered by CP-RT, investigation should be taken by CP-RT team to identify the cause of non-deletion for certain users.","known","SBTS00 2024-01-12, SBTS24R1 2024-01-15, SBTS23R4 No LE Set","[object Object], [object Object], [object Object]","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/qc/?prontos=%22PR739039%22"",""9"")","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/qc/?all_prontos=%22PR739039%22"",""10"")","=HYPERLINK(""https://rep-portal.ext.net.nokia.com/reports/test-runs/?end_db=36500&pronto=%22PR739039%22"",""9"")",0,,58,"First Correction Ready For Testing","SBTS00","3 - Normal","Permanent","B - Major","TOP1_24R1-SR_3.0PD, TOP2_24R1-SR_2.0PD","CR1456173 | SBTS00 | LE: 2024-01-12 | SBTS00_ENB_9999_240112_000014@BLOCKED_PR746009 | Ready for Testing | , CR1457381 | SBTS24R1 | LE: 2024-01-15 | SBTS24R1_ENB_0000_000486_000000 | Correcting | , CR1474397 | SBTS23R4 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_xxx_yyy | Correcting | ","TOP1_24R1-SR_3.0PD, TOP1_24R2-SR_ST, TOP2_24R1-SR_2.0PD, TOP3_24R1-SR_ST","Ville Sipola (Nokia)","NIOYRPET1","Mika Kelloniemi (Nokia)","5G_SC_SW_CN4_CP_RT","Spencer Li (NSB)","NSB MN RAN L3 SW 3 CN","Qiongfei Qiu (NSB)","Cuiying-Tracy Yu (NSB)","MN RAN L3","Kari Skog (Nokia)","MN RAN","Niko Lalu (Nokia)","Spencer Li (NSB)","Tung X.

2024-01-15 S. Räty waiting feedback from the call
2024-01-09 S. Räty 1st draft of the document is in place; pre-review started and final review planned this week Wednesday in the regular TF-meeting for release of the document and closing of this topic
2024-01-08/02 S. Räty CNN proposed. Conclusion is that the cabinet´s own temperature regulation is influencing AMIA temperature directly 
2023-12-31/15 S. Räty TF ongoing and actions from there. Not yet known which team should take this case. Current working hypothesis: The cabinet´s own temperature regulation is influencing AMIA temperature directly; AMIA just follows the pattern.
2023-12-13 Szczepkowicz: SBTS23R4 CNA - Decision made on SCRUB meeting during hand over with Maintenance: G. Golonka, R. Kudla, A. Miskowicz, M. Waegemans
SBTS24R1 Correction form created base build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007)
2023-12-15/05 S. Räty TF ongoing and actions from there. Not yet known which team should take this case
2023-11-28 Tihamala: Wrong GiC - SW TF ongoing and SW Group to be used as currenlty SW logs analysis is ongoing.
2023-11-27 Tihamala: TF ongoing
2023-11-22 Herbert Breibisch RC investigation started: so far we don't know whether RC is related to Nokia or 3rd party equipment and Nokia equipment is just showing the symptoms
in case it is related to Nokia product(s) we don't know yet whether its SW or HW related: acquisition of required LOGs and data started
2023-11-22 Antti Teirikko Case moved to HW, asked HW to be provided for investigation. Meeting series ongoing with this case, invitation accepted
2023-11-23 Antti Teirikko Asked HW to be provided for investigation, that is not possible at the moment, syncro meeting to be held today afternoon
2023-11-24 Antti Teirikko: Meeting held today, discussion ongoing to understand the behavior related the fluctuation issue 
2023-11-27 Antti Teirikko, Meeting held, trying to collect some additional information from case. 
2023-11-28: Antti Teirikko, meeting held today, black box data to be investigated more closely. Snapshots from the different sites trying to be find, with slightly different behavior for comparison to understand the RC for fluctuation
2023-11-29 Antti Teirikko Handel via B.class pronto now. Team checks completeness of data sets and their correlation captured from previous site-visits. Need of a further site visit of customer care and R&D proposed as not all needed data has been collected. Impact correlation from those cases where the cabinet is powering the radios to be handled. Investigation continue with 3 sites, where one site symptoms not similar as others
2023-11-30 Antti Teirikko  Discussion ongoing if RPMAINT_HW_FAN_BTS_SM PRONTO is correct pronto group, discussion still ongoing. Synchronous snapshots from 3 visited sites taken, graphics generated  and analyzing ongoing. Site HW setups under investigation to understand the conditions where AMIA´s has been installed.
2023-01-12 Antti Teirikko site visit of customer care and R&D proposed. Discussion related to move to SW group continued
2023-04-12 Antti Teirikko Operator gave some indoor site addresses where AMIA has installed in an open rack, but other site BTS ID not known, further questionnaire to operator to be made to get the needed logs. Discussion related to correct type of pronto group continues (HW to SW)
2023-05-12  Discussion ongoing if RPMAINT_HW_FAN_BTS_SM PRONTO is correct pronto group- this should be discussed between stakeholders, cannot be decided in this forum, needs escalation
2023-06-12  Antti Teirikko Current working hypothesis: The cabinet´s own temperature regulation is influencing AMIA temperature directly; AMIA just follows the pattern, site visit needed
2023-07-12 Antti Teirikko Indoor installation AMIA proposed, data graph to be make. Thermocouples to be installed and follow temperature behavior. Site permission needed 3 sites. Decided when snapshots will be taken.
2023-08-11 following continue, no further actions today
2023-11-12 Antti Teirikko: Current working hypothesis: The cabinet´s own temperature regulation is influencing AMIA temperature directly; AMIA just follows the pattern.
Need of a further site visit of customer care as not all needed data has been collected
Get more detailed information about this HPL3 cabinet 
 taking a black-box snapshot from a different TMO set up e.g. one standalone sub-rack 
need is to get logs min. 24h's = extended to 48h's
2023-12-12 Antti Teirikko Once the ambient temperature goes below 14°C (internal cabinet FANs are switched off ) only AMIA FANs are rotating leading to a more smoother / flat temp. curve, this is another hint that AMIA FAN-/sub-rack temperature control is just ""following"" the cabinet internal temperature pattern
2023-13-12 Antti Teirikko •	We concentrate our investigations on these 3 site in Phoenix
site. Also Change power load = what happens to the fluctuations? (= plain LAB based experiment)
(this could potentially be investigated by the NEBS team.	collect data from a Nokia cabinet to see how the situation is here,  we could do such a test in Hz in case we know the way how the cabinets gets operated in fluctuation case.
2023-14-12 Antti Teirikko No actions today
2023-15-12 Antti Teirikko Meeting today was mostly planning to coming site visit, how to proceed, what is the data needed for and how to get access to needed sites
2023-18-12 Antti Teirikko Site visit ongoing, data loggers assembled to some customer sites and collected the information. Later information to be collected and leave still loggers working with another memories, in case external data will be needed. Current working hypothesis: The cabinet´s own temperature regulation is influencing AMIA temperature directly; AMIA just follows the pattern. This needs to be verified, based on the logs, whether this is the case. 
2023-12-19 Antti Teirikko First logs from data loggers received and investigated, there is still need for additional measurements. Temperature sensors to be assembled in other locations and record the needed data. Next meeting planned 21-12-2023 
2023-12-20 Antti Teirikko Not meeting today , discussions and investigation related to data analyzing and new data logging conditions
2023-12-21 Antti Teirikko Based on latest results the TF-team is proposing to set this PR to CNN; RCA containing more details of the conclusion will be provided. 	· Conclusion is that the cabinet´s own temperature regulation is influencing AMIA temperature directly,  AMIA just follows the pattern. 	· Next site visit happened on Dec 21st, 23 further data logging started and is taking till Dec 22nd, 23 
= on Dec 22nd 2023 TF-meeting we will further discuss this / have a look to the results
2023-12-22 Antti Teirikko: Based on latest results the TF-team is proposing to set this PR to CNN. 	·Conclusion is that the cabinet´s own temperature regulation is influencing AMIA temperature directly 
= i.e. AMIA just follows the pattern. 
2024-01-02: Antti Teirikko: waiting confirmation to close this as CNN
2024-01-03 Antti Teirikko: SW team provide the RCA slide for closing, waiting the report
2024-01-03 Antti Teirikko: Still waiting the report
2024-01-04 Antti teirikko Waiting confirmation from SW team to provide the RCA report to customer
2024-01-08 Antti Teirikko: SW team preparation for RC report starts today. 
2024-01-09 Antti Teirikko: TF-meeting agreed tomorrow (10.01.2024)

2023-12-26: RC unknown, RCA is still ongoing, IR for DEB knife tested, waiting for L2PS analysis
2023-12-20 FC: PR is back to us. Assign to Mani for investigation
2023-12-14 FC: Tester have tried the suggested configuration(maxNumPdschAllocationPerSlot = 8). The throughput is better than before. But it is not reach the level of reference. Parallel there is discussion about if the problem can trigger a CNI.
2023-12-13 FC: This is a DLs issue. Investigation is ongoing.
2023-12-12 [L2PS_BLR]: We see no issue from L2PS SW point of view, some points needs to be clarified from SFS team for system level behaviour, will transfer PR to SFS team for further check. 
2023-12-11 [L2PS_BLR] : Checking the knife logs, will share finding today.
2023-12-08 [L2PS_BLR]: Knife is being prepared for PF/TD Metric calculation logs, will share it today, still not able to reproduce issue in SCT even though making exact config like PET scenario.
2023-12-07 [L2PS_BLR]: With IR logs with lesser number of non CA UE through put improvement observed, discussion ongoing with SFS team member regarding ALG changes which can impact on PF/TD metric calculation. SCT TCs prepared but issue not reproducing as PET, still trying if it can be reproduced in SCT.
2023-12-06 [L2PS_BLR]: IR raised for checking UE DRX state also SCT reproduction is being tried, still no reproduction in SCT.
2023-12-05 [L2PS_BLR]: Local SCT reproduction is being tried to check behaviour at various flow in code whether any commit has changed behaviour for PF Metric calculation or not.
2023-12-04 [L2PS_BLR]: Discussion ongoing with Spec along with TF members to find the reason for change in L2PS scheduler behaviour
2023-12-01 [L2PS_BLR]: ABIQ throughput is 15Mbps better that ABIO, L2PS discussion ongoing with A&S team for the current behavior of L2PS scheduler algorithm and if it can be improved for all PRB utilization in few scenario.

2023-12-22 Timo Koskinnen: We have to wait with delivery until the fix is still verified in the field sites. No LE yet. 
2023-12-21/20 Heikki.1.Autio: Official fix is under delivery process, LE for IB2311027: 22.12.
2023-12-19 Heikki.1.Autio:All was working from PS pow in yesterdays knife. I would predict packet loss to be solved. I will start review for fixes anyway still today.
2023-12-18 Heikki.1.Autio: OK logs under caps-v link has been provided via IR328430 response. To be checked. 
2023-12-15 Heikki.1.Autio: NCT to collect logs to compare from earlier release where Huawei IQC is working. IR will be created. 
2023-12-14 Heikki.1.Autio: Last knife 1095540 passed - fix is working as expected, but I'm afraid it does not fully fix the issue.Maybe fix is also  needed from OAM side. To be clarify today.
2023-12-13 Heikki.1.Autio: Failed at UPHWAPI part, seems like a connection issue from WFT to UPHWAPI repo. I will re-trigger: Knife 1095261 - Workflow Tool (nokia.com)
2023-12-12 Heikki.1.Autio:  IR327781 responded - correction knife failed. Logs from retest to be checked.
2023-12-11 Heikki.1.Autio: Correction knife1093575 has been shared to CT for verification. IR327781 has been created, LE 13.12.

2023-12-07 Petar Barac New updated knife will be provided during day(checking of last logs done).
2023-12-06 Petar Barac Crash in logs yesterday was due to debugging overload,updated correction knife provided one more time.Retest will be done during day.Developer is OoO so if new logs will be provided until EOB today, will be checked tomorrow.With correction-knife we try to confirm RC.
2023-12-05 Petar Barac New correction knife is sent and answered with more logs after crash.Log are under checking of HeikkiA
2023-12-01 Heikki 1. Autio: Correction knife will be provided. LE: EOB. 
2023-11-30: [Timo Koskinen] The problem seems to be that TS_MISM recovery takes too long when Huawei IQC is is use and I am currently working on a fix for that, but need to test the fix locally first. 
2023-11-29: [Timo Koskinen]  IR326301 send with debug knife. LE for response tbp.
2023-11-28: [Timo Koskinen] I hadn't noticed to add ""Extra BTS package"" flag to the knife creation, and that's why the CMCC packages were missing, which I believe have the correct Kytkin version. I made a new knife which now also includes also these CMCC packages. IR with new debug knife will be created. 
2023-11-27: [Timo Koskinen] IR325822 responded- after Knife upgrade, FID1806 was raised from FISH. It really seems that Kytkin version is wrong in the knife, I will check what is causing this.
2023-11-24: [Timo Koskinen]  IR325822 with debug knife send. The knife has been shared to CT for verification. I think we can expect the results/logs early next week.
SBTS24R1 Correction form created base build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007)
2023-11-23: [Timo Koskinen] I suspect that the 02986156 fix might not work completely correctly in IQC's case. To confirm this I make next a knife where the TS_MISM recovery function is restored to the level before the 02986156 fix.
2023-11-22: [Timo Koskinen] SBTS23R1_FSM3 SBTS23R1_FSM3_0000_000276_000000 contains 02986156: [23R1 Rollout] Sleeping cell on ND_RS_LE_MONTAL_ORF (FSMF) (nokia.com) fix related to the TS_MISM recovery functionality, so could it somehow be related to this problem. I am looking into it.
2023-11-21: [Timo Koskinen] BOAM analysis has been provided. It seems that we still need to investigate CPRI/Kytkin driver, could it be that the TS_MISM recovery functionality does not work correctly when IQC is in use.
2023-11-21 [DCMM] lixiang: @HWAPI please recheck the issue as the ts_mis not related with AxC timing configuration.
2023-11-20: [Timo Koskinen] Investigation is still ongoing, I will try to figure out next plan today.
2023-11-18 M. Dmochowski: Need Kytkin experts to take a look at this. 02774331 fix is contained in tested package.

2023-12-22:[CP_RT] prathap: Moved to OAM for NRTS and DCS changes. Trunk - NA; 24R1/CP_RT :Code changes merged.
Delivered the code changes from CP-RT on 24R1.And bevaiour from CP-RT mentioned and attached the doc: IBA_CP-RT_Resolution.
Trunk:Needless, since OAM limitation would be addressed in the Trunk.
2023-12-21: 24R1 : Code changes are under review.Trunk: Needless.
2023-12-19 Shriram: PR received in CPRT for doing the SW implementation. CPRT side SW implementation has started. After CPRT side completion, PR will be moved to OAM for implementation from DCS and NRTS pov. 
2023-12-18 FC: Review is still ongoing. There is comment on the SFS
2023-12-15 Hartmut Feile: The SFS review is ongoing (LE for the review Dec 15th EOB).
2023-12-14 Hartmut Feile: PDM finally approved our foreseen correction proposal.  A&S provided the required SFS update and initiated a review (LE for the review Dec 15th EOB).  The currently expected software impact is BOAM (DCS and NRTS), CP-RT as well as CuDo changes.
2023-12-13 Hartmut Feile: A&S provided a very first draft of the needed SFS requirement updates.  We still miss the final agreement from PDM who wanted to check the real ABIN customer impact.
2023-12-12 Hartmut Feile: We had a meeting with all stakeholders and agreed on the further proceeding.  The overall effort to fix this issue in 24R1 is too big.  It was therefore decided to disable CB009215-F completely for ABIN in 24R1 (restriction).  CB009215-F will be available again for 24R2 in combination with CB007804.  No LE can be given so far.
2023-12-11 Hartmut Feile: The FOT lead proposed these two different options how to proceed with this issue:  
1) Implement the fix in 24R1 - need CNI for that or use the descoping CNI existing already CNI-107243 (Decommit CB007804 and extend it to 24R2).
2) Skip the 24R1 and keep 24R2 as delivery release for this ABIN part.
2023-12-08 Hartmut Feile: PR738816 blocks the usage of ABIN in 24R1 as soon as the automated prachConfigurationIndex assignment is enabled.  No decision has been made yet on how to address this issue.  All stakeholders are part of the ongoing discussion (FOT leader, RCE, PDM, Program Mangement).
2023-12-07 Hartmut Feile: The CB009215 FOT lead was involved to take care about this ""missed impact"" issue.  PR738816 should be managed via the ""missed impact features handling"" process and not via the pronto process.
2023-12-06 Hartmut Feile: This foreseen correction proposal is a complete new feature from BOAM/DCS point of view.  This would be porting a feature on a maintenance branch via pronto.  No LE can be given at all.
2023-12-04 Hartmut Feile: This is a quite complex topic with significant implementation and test effort:
After enabling automated prachConfigurationIndex assignment on ABIN with the legacy configuration of CB006912 (NR ABIN BB cell sets 12 cells NR FDD CPRI and OBSAI), we observe a failed cell setup of one cell.
This is provoked by the special configuration for ABIN in CB006912, which has two L1 pools per Loki instead of the typical one L1 pool per Loki.
In this case, the automated prachConfigurationIndex allocation in BOAM NRTS conflicts with the csiRsPoolingGroup allocation in CP-RT.

To solve the issue, we propose to change the ABIN deployment and to take the L1 pool type from CB006913 (NR ABIO BB cell sets 24 cells FDD CPRI and OBSAI) and to take the L2 deployment from the coming CB007804 (NR BB cell set ABIO 24/ASOE 16/ABIN 12 cells FDD CPRI and OBSAI).
We need to limit the amount of cells on ABIN as per CB006912 expectation as a separate rule for BOAM.

Preliminary, the change requires the following:
5G UP architecture slides update
5G UP spec changes for CSM model based on the slides
5G UP spec changes to ""BOAM rules to follow"" to limit amount of cells as per CB006912 expectation
BOAM SW impacts at least in DCS

2023-11-30 Hartmut Feile: Discussions are still ongoing as to how this deployment problem should be addressed. All experts are on board and try to find a solution.
2023-11-29 Hartmut Feile: A&S suggested several options to resolve this issue.  No decision has been made yet as to which option to choose.  PDM and A&S architects are also involved.
2023-11-28 Hartmut Feile: New transfer to A&S L2RT.  PR738816 is a CB009215 IN-FOT pronto and was assigned to the CB009215 CFAM lead for an initial analysis (24R1 CB009215-SR PRB pooling for FDD cells – concept refinement).

[#Next steps: ]
[Handling] LE: 2024-01-26 [Kari Vierimaa 2023-01-15]: DDAL API definition proposal from LFS C&S on review. Updating BBP synchronization design's to include ASOE and ASOF (AirScale HW). Currently unclear if PTP over SEI interface is actually supported with ASOE. Its specified like this at least in the ASOE HW support feature CFAM document and BBP sync design. Product mgmt input is needed on this as it affect on whether IMI, HWA MO and DDAL API interfaces needs to be update to support SEI or not. Next steps: Finalize needed BBP sync design updates and send them for review.
2023-01-31/04 ZhaoGrace:this is big effort pronto,in order to solve this issue we need first wait for CB010606-F-k to done, then deliver, now plan to deliver this fix move to 24R3.
[Handling] LE: 2024-01-?? [Kari Vierimaa 2023-01-04]: Still waiting intial DDAL API definition proposal from LFS C&S for this functionality. Once its available for review then needed LFS functionality must be discussed and agreed with the affected LFS areas (C&S, base services...). ASOE is supporting PTP through SEI port and according to BBP sync architect this delay compensation needs to be done also within that SEI interface. This means that IMI and HWA MO interface definitions (new port type: SEI) need to be updated already with this pronto and it cannot wait for the coming official Class C performance support feature for Classical HW. On BBP side this interface update impacts to BM, MCU HWAPI and LFS. It also means that PTP protocol performance measurements need to be done for the SEI interface in order to be able to calculate the needed delay compensation values. Initial delay compensation values for the other interfaces and link speeds calculated based on Marko's tests and measurements. Those initial values can then be used as a starting point for final compensation value iteration once the needed SW functionality is in place.
[Handling] LE: 2024-01-?? [Kari Vierimaa 2023-12-20]: RINLINE2 Cloud feature CB010606-F-k BB sync specifications approved. Initial delay compensation values calculated for ASOE and ASOF based on the initial 10 measurements Marko has executed. Next step is to get needed DDAL API definitions proposal from LFS C&S, this is also needed for CB010606-F-k and the same interface is then planned to be used also with Airscale HW and with this pronto. For this pronto discussion and agreement is then needed on which LFS component (C&S, base services...) is going to store and provide those Ingress and Egress delay compensation values to MCU HWAPI when it asks them via that newly defined DDAL API.
[Handling] LE: 2024-01-?? [Kari Vierimaa 2023-12-15]: BB SW correction/change to be applied here for ASOE and ASOF requires functionality implemented with Cloud feature CB010606-F-k as a basis. Once the solution and functionality from Cloud side is available additions needed for Classical side (on Classical LFS (C&S, base layer, core...) provides storage and interface for accessing Ingress & Egress delay compensation data instead of L1 SW which provides this on Cloud (RINLINE2)) can started to be discussed, agreed and then specified. Feature CB010606-F-k is currently under BB sync spec design review which will be finalized during this week. So BB sync spec clarification work for this pronto can start next week, however LFS C&S Technical leader is on vacation until Wednesday 20.12.2023 and then there is only 3 days left before Christmas vacation period begins. So realistically it will be January 2024 before BB SW clarifications, agreement and specification will be ready for this pronto.

2023-12-11 [Sync SFS]: correction delivered - transfer for further implementation to be done today:

2023-12-04 Sitarska: 1) IR pending, for ASOF there are 10 measurement results for 1G electrical, 1G optical, 10G and 25G. ASOE measurements ongoing, started today for 1G electrical first. 2) trying to agree transfer to BOAM_CA_SFS as it seems to be big effort pronto where many teams deliver their changes, it could be started from SFS, but still under confirmation
2023-11-30/12-1 Sitarska: 1) IR still pending, LE for response: end of the week, 2) discussion with BOAM and TRS ongoing
2023-11-28/29 Sitarska: 1) IR sent, we need more runs(e,g ten times, more is better) on ASOE/ASOF each optical&Electrical link speed to get cTE value to help on the SW compensation value, LE for response end of week; 2) in parallel SFS A&S experts were involved in discussion; 3) BOAM/TRS involved to define the solution (e.g how to handling  SW compensation  based on link speed)
2023-11-27 Sitarska: next steps not clear, sync up meeting with architects and spec needed

2024-01-15 TomaszSokolowski: [RFSW] PR741956  Passed on 24r1 but PR738635 failed on 23R4. IR sent under PR738635 to see if testing completed under attached PR is NOT a false positive and proove the issue has been resolved somewhere between 23R3 and 24R1 to provide more insight into investigation. 
2024-01-12 MaciejSkolarczyk: [RFSW] Correction failed, therefore link break as a possible RC is greatly reduced. Firewall is also excluded. Brainstorming further possibilities, why packets might not be sent through 50G link. LE: EOD
2024-01-11 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] PR set as RFT, there is a suspicion that correction from 03445856 is working for the case. In the meantime the analysis of the issue is ongoing. 
2024-01-10 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] The potential RC is somewhere inside Mars-Thor interaction, in RU. Currently there is no visible any internal link break. Need to continue the investigation. 
2024-01-09 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Seems that previous conception wasn't good, need to find some other way of debugging this issue. Case has been reassigned to TL. 
2024-01-08 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Waiting for the info regarding mentioned debug knife. LE: 01-09. 
2023-01-06 Dgawlowski: [RFSW] Logs are being checked, experimental debug knife to be prepared for better RC understanding. LE EOB/Sunday. 
2023-01-04 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Waiting for the IR answer. LE: today should be started proceeding by the PR's author. 
2024-01-03 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Waiting for the IR answer. Tester's team confirmed that it should be done today. LE: 01-04
2024-01-02 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Waiting for the IR answer. 01-03. 
2023-12-29 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Last IR has been updated, waiting for the answer. LE: 01-03.
2023-12-27 IacobanAnatolie [ST_RFS]  No valid link for knife download in IR. IR response is delayed until new link is updated. LE: 28 dec
2023-12-27 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] New IR with debug knife created, waiting for the IR answer. LE: 12-31.
2023-12-22 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Waiting for the IR answer to check if the issue is still visible. 
2023-12-20 SebastianGadzinski: [RFSW] Due to mistake in previous IR we don't have all needed logs. Waiting for new IR reproduction. In the mean time logs analysis from previous IR continues
2023-12-18 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] New IR with updated commands raised. Waiting for the feedback. LE: 12-19.
2023-12-15 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Preparing the knife which should enable collecting tcpdumps during reproduction. LE: EOB. 
2023-12-13 & 2023-12-11: BOAM_FRONTHAUL: Zhi Yuan: Status: IR327593 analysis done, the ping and tcpdump do not cover time slots of issue. Offline teams with tester and retest is ongoing.
2023-12-09 BOAM_FRONTHAUL: Zhi Yuan: Status: tcp dump is captured in IR logs to verify soap message is lost on which side, IR responded, checking IR logs.
2023-12-07 SebastianGadzinski: [RFSW] FID 16 was not raised due first SM not responding for about 30sec and missing MRA while second SM is being restarted. Analysis attached pronto will be transferred to L1_BOAM
2023-12-06 KlaudiaBras: [RFSW] Investigation ongoing, topic will be discussed internally for defining some next steps. LE: EOB.
2023-12-05 SebastianGadzinski: [RFSW] Links are toggling because of tests scenario (disabling and enabling SFPs on BBMOD). ""UDPCP msg not sent"" is also related to test scenario, because disabling SFP breaks M-Plane towards that BBMOD, so ""UDPCP msg not sent"" is expected. M-Plane towards second BBMOD still works. Checking SOAPs if FID16 alarm is tried to be raised through working M-Plane.

2023-12-20 BKopacz [CP] A knife with old build and the new platform was created to chek if it's platform's fault. The knife with reverted platform was too problematic to create, this solution is safer. The IR is raised and the test will be running during the night
2023-12-15 CPLN [KMS]: After consultations with platform knife requested with revert of platform, to check the impact. Ticket to SCM raised
2023-12-13: P.Zegar: Issue originally not caused by CPlane change, improvements on CPlane side introduced (reduction of overload by 2/3 by improving deployment). Improvements in platform needed to improve CPU time scheduling.
2023-12-08 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: LE for correctoin on monday 2023-12-11. Testing over weekend with automation, results on monday
2023-12-07 [PET] Jary Kokkonen:  IR327165 LE on 2023-12-08, runs still ongoing, need more time until all ran. Meanwhile made runs already provided info and logs in TEAMS for devers.
2023-12-05 [PET] LE for IR327165 is on 2023-12-07. IR testing is started today and ongoing  via automation for the Finnish bank holiday 2023-12-06 until Thursday morning.
2023-11-28 P.Zegar: Logs shows that there is problem with test configuration. In short there is too much CA in relation to Cell limits (200 UE), this causes CA rejections, problems with crnti allocation on MAC and spikes in messages that causes also spikes in queue load and contribute to overload. Issue exist also in ""passing test"" case.
2023-11-24 P.Zegar: Increasing number of UEC worker threads from 2 to 3 helps, but some overload (~10s) is still visible. IR325853 doesn't look perfect (UEC threads were not pin to cores as requested), TM looks lower on first ABIP and lot of issues with CA (maxNumCaUeScell: 400 would be exceeded) related to configuration are visible in logs.  Also IRQ were not pin to core 0 (didn't work or were not executed) on first ABIP. Assuming that result for second IR with 3 worker threads is a max that we can squeeze from this deployment. Next steps would be to compare syslog from passing and IR325549 run, check if CA is also failing, and if it could be improved somehow by adjusting test or configuration.
2023-11-23 [PET]Jary Kokkonen:  LE for IR325853  on 27.11.
2023-11-23 [PET] LE for IR325853  on 24.11.
2023-11-23 haras: IR will be sent: move irq to core 0, bind uec worker threads, first to core 1, second to core 2, third to core 3, just to see if there is some mess with cache. leave cellc and uec master thread unpin
SBTS24R1 Correction form created base build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007)
2023-11-22 haras: check if increasing number of cplane threads (reducing load on single thread) will help, LE: today
2023-11-21 P.Zegar: Results shown that issue isn't connected to Core 0, but top logs shown that UEC worker thread operate on a edge, and we share CPU also with Disp 0 leaving even less spare CPU power to CPlane. IR 2 created to test possible correction that would be simply changing deployment from 2 worker threads to 3 worker threads, and that should lower CPU usage per thread from ~80% to ~53% and result in better HW utilization.
2023-11-21 P.Zegar: Hypothesis is that what happens on Core 0 (interrupts) impacts a CPlane stability and causes jittering on board that leads to CPlane overload. Next steps is to verify this hypothesis.
2023-11-21 haras: sync call at 9 am between CC&S, Kernel, CPLANE
2023-11-20: J.Hohnheiser: Przemyslaw to organize TF tomorrow; CCS and c-plane (first analysis) expert needed.
2023-11-20 wiehler: Both builds use the same minor kernel version (5.15.128), so the diff is fairly minimal - there are only 3 Marlin-related commits that could have any influence at all. To be further discussed with Anis.
2023-11-17 haras: under check in Base Layer
2023-11-16: Anis MONSER: impact of softirq movement should be checked by kernel team
2023-11-15: P.Zegar: CPlane CPU usage, Traffic model did not change between pass and fail build. Strange cpu load visible in both builds on ABIP board in compare to ABIO.

2023-12-18 Jani Kalttonen: Solution agreement ongoing between Spec / MCU / LFS
2023-12-15 [McuHwapi] DaviauCyril: One solution is that when IcomS receives first poll RESP reset or ADET CPU IND for ABIx primary CPU it could send API2_GET_RESET_STATE_REQ_MSG to read the lifetime reset counter, @damien to check if this solution is possible.
Then it can be later used for communication failure signature if it happens (and in rare case that no RESP is received e.g. FSP is already crashed here then leave the counter out).
2023-12-15 Jani Kalttonen: One solution proposal from MCU. If not acceptable then goes to Spec. LE to conclude today (postponed from yesterday)

2024-01-15 [RF-HW]: Tested RF Monitor Tool, v81 and v84.  v84 has different windowing function. We still see a discrepancy with noise and CW, ~2dB. According to SW and DSP guys, this discrepancy is expected. Working with chief engineers to understand why this is or if there is some solution. This discrepancy may need to be explained to customers in the future. There's an active email discussion on this topic. Will close before end of week.
024-01-09 Sheena [RF HW]: We are still seeing discrepancy between CW and noise. Rod is checking with Russell on this.
2024-01-08 Sheena [RF HW]: Tested the latest SW and it seems to be working   after we allow all the security permission to ""full control"" for v84.  This wasn't needed for earlier SW versions.  Will do some more testing to compare and capture the results with v81 and v84. 
2024-01-04 Sheena [RF HW]: The latest RFSW that we received and tested seems to have some bug that needs to be fixed. We are waiting on the fix from SW on this.
2023-12-20 R. Kirkhart [RF HW] Update to below. Waiting for new SW will power correction. This will likely affect scaling. Once SW is received will test on all variants. Will take one day.
2023-12-19 R. Kirkhart [RF HW] Tested all variants with SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007. Measured / calculated power with scans from RF Monitor-0000_000081. Noise (PSD) , LTE power is accurate, CW peak is 1 to 2.5 dB low which is acceptable. Scaling values provided in associated Teams chat. Updating AHFII PFC for this pronto.
2023-12-15 KristiinaEade[RF A&S] All Zodiac variants and  PFC update needed by Dallas RF HW team. Agreed with Russell Morris & Rod Kirkhart. No change needed from RF A&S ( HWSW PS)

2023-12-11: TNiva [RF A&S]: Need confirmation from Dallas related to what accuracy needed (sine wave and noise spike accuracy). Otherwise clear and correction planned to do based on noise (~-1.3 dB).
2023-11-30: TNiva [RF A&S]: checking ongoing with US RF HW team to find solution to parallel sine wave and noise accuracy. Result expected 30th Nov.
2023-11-29: TNiva [RF A&S]: checking ongoing with US RF HW team. Result expected 30th Nov.
2023-11-27: TNiva [RF A&S]: checking ongoing with US RF HW team.
2023-11-22 KristiinaEade [RF A&S] pre-analysis needed with RF HW  team, what values were used in testing and to confirm those are correct ones. not know if any spec changes are needed or not and thus LE tbd.
2023-11-22 PiotrPawlikowski [RFSW] NewDev assign, investigation ongoing. 1st step: verification compatibility with the Spec. LE: 2023-11-23
2023-11-21 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Krzystof have found mathematical correction according to used window. The first acceptable is Hamming window, so i will back to Hamming in official rf monitor tool. It partially fix the problem, but still there is required some update of PSF in draco/A&S/PCF.
here is new release of backend:
https://wrgitlab.ext.net.nokia.com/rfmonitordevs/rfmonitorlibs/-/releases/v.1.6
this was released in RFMONITOR_0000_000081_000000
2023-11-20 MKrawczynski [RFSW] More time was needed for our expert to analyze this case
2023-11-17 MKrawczynski [RFSW] We still do not have clear plan what needs to be done to fix this case :
there are two issues:
wrong power scaling value from radio control - fix about 3dB in line 3
wrong window was chosen,  suggestion how to fix that needed from Rod (HW DPD) or Petri (A&S). 
If the spec needs to be updated we need to do that first. Discussion and additional internal testing ongoing. Next steps and actions possibly on Monday
2023-11-16 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Draco states that Scaling factor is set according to spec hence we need A&S expert to chime in on this
2023-11-15 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Radio control assigned the expert today and the analysis has been started by them. Waiting for any info about the next steps
2023-11-14 MKrawczynski [RFSW] Scaling factor seems to be causing the issue here. Draco team involved as this is managed by them
2023-11-13 MKrawczynski [RFSW] New case, assigned and the analysis will start today.

STATUS: 
A few findings so far:
- fault 7702(E1 setup failure) is not harmful
- what really leads to fault 4539 is CPNB responded NOK pool configuration resp to OAM. One of the data distribution from CPNB to CPUE is timed-out

2024-01-05 S. Räty LFS net was involved in investigation yesterday. Confirm/check switch behavior. Why we see that the link is blocked and why we see time gap ~40 seconds. This is looking a little similar to PR736347. More time is needed for this investigation. On hold today because of bank holiday LE?
2024-01-03 Oleh N: issue looks to be strictly related to lfs-networking/TRS. There is delay between TRS check and switch state change. Open question is switch state checked only once and why that fault state is latched if it is. Anyway I don't have enough expertise to create strictly switch related knife. lfs-networking support required 
2023-12-29 Oleh N.: From aux-net perspective behaviour is expected and it was previously described in analysis for PR737775. Though knife requested by TRS team needs some time to be ready

2023-12-27: [NETCONF_EFS] cinciule: draft for correction started. 
2023-12-22: Idriss Cheurfa: WA agreed: DU shall mute the alarm VSF 21005 ""symbol data error"" and ""eAxC ID mismatch"" for the carriers that are in in-active state. No LE yet.
2023-12-20: Idriss Cheurfa: Awaiting agreement from BOAM to take the PR after WA agreed. LE 21/12.

2023-12-08 Hartmut Feile: PR737646 was assigned for an initial analysis.  It is still unclear if the pronto is in the correct pronto group.  No LE can be given so far.
2023-12-06: Idriss Cheurfa: This is not RRM_UP issue, looking into to find right GiC. LE 07/12.
2023-12-01: [Anand]: FJT has shared the analysis and it is attached with this PR, they told to check further from DU side , please DU team check and provide fix for this issue.
PR reopened to investigate further this issue form DU side.

2023-11-16 Still no conclusion established. From NETCONF pov behavior is correct and issue needs to be fixed in 3rd party - FJT radio. 
Another call set for tomorrow 9:00 CET time with FJT, test architect, L1 and Netconf representatives.

2023-11-14 Call planned with FJT tomorrow morning. We expect to conclude solution tomorrow. If solution will be on FJT side, solution will be followed via this ticket: https://jiradc.ext.net.nokia.com/browse/ORAN_PZ_BLR_INTEGRAT-186 and this PR will be closed with CNN 3rd party issue.

2023-11-13 [NETCONF]: Discussions ongoing with FJT, current assumption is that there might some issues with the radio in processing the received eAxc ids over M-Plane as there's no mismatch between eaxc-ids used in M-Plane and CU-Plane according to the analysis from DU perspective.
10.11.2023 [NETCONF]: values was declared in M-Plane as NETCONF_AGENT sends the values that DCS calculates all the time
10.11.2023 [DCS/BBCALC] matlag: DCS calculated values 20528, 20529, 20536, 20537.

2024-01-11 [PERFMGMT] bojici: Flamegraph generation currently not possible due to virtual machine environment issues that are being worked on. Work ongoing to get partial fix live-network ready.
2024-01-11 [PERFMGMT] bojici: Analysis of knife results ongoing. Work to continue after to get partial fix live-network ready.
2024-01-09 [PERFMGMT] bojici: IR raised with knife containing cache service for CPU profiling
2024-01-09 [PET] Nico Moilanen:  Test line reserved for customer case. LE for testing IR, Monday 01-15.  
2024-01-08 Oana Bunas:  TF for attached case just ended, Knife under preparation with possible improvement.
2023-12-21 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Work ongoing. Optimization still planned to reduce local info model interrogation as much as possible in order to reduce BStat CPU usage (this includes storing information in a local cache such as LNBTSid/MRBTSid/LNCEL/NRCEL/PLMN/URI). Currently internal testing revealed certain information (for example LNCEL/NRCELL information) is not stored in cache long enough for it to be usable by LOM PM.
Next steps:
-Check the current implementation step by step to narrow down where/why stored information is lost.
-After issues are fixed locally (unit/module tests pass = legacy flow theoretically not affected) test on real hardware to check that functionality is in order.
-Raise IR for flame graph/CPU profiling of knife containing fixed implementation
-Check flame graph for optimization impact
-If optimization has positive effect, proceed with delivery
2023-12-20 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Fix not working as intended. Further implementation needed. new LE for delivery 2024-01-12
2023-12-19 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Internal testing of updated fix ongoing

2023-12-13 Szczepkowicz: SBTS23R4 CNA - Decision made on SCRUB meeting during hand over with Maintenance: G. Golonka, R. Kudla, A. Miskowicz, M. Waegemans
2023-12-13 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Second knife didn't fix the issue. Currently working on a fix before IR is raised and optimization effects are tested, as this issue could break legacy functionality.
2023-12-12 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Initial internal testing results revealed one additional issue that is being worked on. Another knife currently building to be internally tested with potential fix to identified issue.
2023-12-11 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Implementation done, fixed issues that could be found locally. Internal testing to be started in the morning (2023-12-12) for any potential functionality/flow issues. IR with knife will be raised for CPU profiling if no functionality issues are found during internal testing.
2023-12-08 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Implementation mostly done, running build locally to fix any issues before starting local testing. If no major issues result from local testing, knife LE 2023-12-11.
2023-12-07 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Implementation almost done, local testing expected to start tomorrow (Friday 2023-12-08).  LE for knife to be provided for PET/lab testing: 2023-12-11.
2023-12-06 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Implementation still ongoing. When implementation is done, local testing to be done before providing knife for PET/lab testing, as this workaround is a legacy functionality change, to avoid regressions. new LE for knife to be provided for testing: 2023-12-11
2023-12-05 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Implementation ongoing.
2023-12-04 [PERFMGMT]bojici: Implementation started. First optimization step knife LE: 2023-12-07

Next steps:
-Incremental optimizations, checking evolution after each iteration
	1. Identify areas that use the most CPU
	2. Check what optimizations are possible
	3. Implement optimizations
	4. Test optimizations impact
-Currently identified one area where improvements can be made
	1. Reduce BSTAT interrogation of LIM for BTSID/LNBTSID/URIs
	2. Discussion ongoing regarding implementation
	3. Expected to start implementation of first optimization step next Monday (30th and 1st are bank holidays in Romania).
	4. LE for knife containing this first optimization step will also be provided on Monday (4th Dec)
2023-11-28 [PERFMGMT]bojici: decoding and analysis ongoing, LE for next steps: 11-29
2023-11-27 [PET] Moilanen: testing started. LE for logs Tuesday 11-28

2023-11-23 [PERFMGMT]bojici: IR raised for BStat memory and CPU profiling
 Current plan:
-Wait for sw profiling (memory and CPU)
-Check for possible code optimizations where bottlenecks happen
-Try to reduce BSTAT access/use to LIM to decrease number of queries.

2024-01-15 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] PR in RFT state - the deadline for testing to be discussed on the chat.
2024-01-15 Zhengle Xia [ST] Test ok up to now. Continue to verify, will pass the correction tomorrow if no issue.
2024-01-13 Zhengle Xia [ST] Correction build under testing, will check result on Monday.
2024-01-12 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Code merged, per CI Lead the promotion should happen till EoB - this means that SBTS build to move it into RFT should be ready at around 8PM CET, to be set up.
2024-01-11 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Code should be merged till 12PM CET - probably the SBTS build to be used will be available 12/01.
2024-01-10 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Merge to be done from DAPD side till EoB, spec update and PR closure to be also done till tomorrow to enter RFT. 
2024-01-10 Zhengle Xia [ST] No issue found up to now. IR responded. Will continue to test and wait official build.
2024-01-09 Zhengle Xia [ST] Testing 224 times with correction knife. Waiting official build.
2024-01-08 Zhengle Xia [ST] Testing 186 times with correction knfie, keep running.  
2024-01-05 Zhengle Xia [ST] The correction knife test is running. LE: 10/01 ? Still check with FOTL and SW.
2024-01-04 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] IR with our WA (correction knife) was sent, to be tested till 12/01. If no faults seen, then the next steps to be clarified then (either we merge the WA or test it longer, as the occ/rate is low).
2024-01-03 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Possible WA discussed internally within dirty-rf - brief LE for it would be 10/03, as it would take some time and testing (and Friday is free for Poland). Awaiting the final confirmation from Petri regarding the WA.
2024-01-02 SZajaczkowski: [RFSW] Seems like RFIC issue, the WA(?) is being discussed within chat with specification engineers. To be discussed further with our architect to figure out the next steps today.
2023-12-29 MKrawczynski: [RFSW] Discusstion with A&S ongoing, uDTx disabled during LOnulling is the proposition here. We need DPD expert to chime in on this, he will be back in Janurary so this discussion will be continued then. 
2023-12-28 MKrawczynski: [RFSW] We need A&S team to help find the optimal solution here. Currently no LE for that
2023-12-27 MKrawczynski: [RFSW] Test showed that issue is clearly related to rfic runtime calibrations. we see huge power jump in gc (which means that not only we are getting iq imbalance but also LO spike goes up) after some next iteration of lo nulling (but not the next one), FB power goes down (so LO spike is nulled again) and also mse recovers fb jumps make recovery very long, that is why alarm is raised. 
Having 1908 instead of 1907 showed, that alarm can recover with time. This issue is happening with udtx enabled.
Discussion with A&S ongoing about the potential solution here 
2023-12-25 Zhengle Xia [ST] Reproduced successfully, 1908 reported by third AZQC. IR responded.
2023-12-25 Zhengle Xia [ST] 272 times test did not reproduce the issue.Keep running.

2023-12-22 Zhengle Xia [ST] 80 times test did not reproduce the issue.Keep running.
2023-12-22 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] Awaiting the reproduction on new IR - no LE due to low occurrence.
2023-12-21 Zhengle Xia [ST] Added RF syslog collection. Begin to reproduce this issue. Running 12 times. LE: Open.
2023-12-20 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] Unluckily IR response does not cover fault appearance - additional IR has been sent, no LE.
2023-12-20 Zhengle Xia [ST] IR responded as issue reproduced. But seems missing runtime logs when issue happen. There may be a new IR for collecting syslog for each radio.
2023-12-19 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] No reproduction till now - due to low reprodicibility we are still blocked by that. 
2023-12-18 Zhengle Xia [ST] 211 times test dit not reproduce the issue.
2023-12-18 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] No reproduction with latest IR caught yet - still under testing, no LE.

2023-12-16 Zhengle Xia[ST] 103 times test did not reproduce the issue. Keep running.
2023-12-15 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] Awaiting the IR response - if it is responded to on the weekend, our on-call developer has been involved to push this case forward on Sat/Sun.
2023-12-15 Zhengle Xia[ST]: 38 times test did not reproduce the issue. Plan to continue reproducing today and over the weekend.
2023-12-14 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] Additional IR has been raised - we have few suspicions in draco/RFIC scope, but we need IR response to be sure. Quick summary to be done from our side to update everyone on the state of investigation. Possible weekend support will be requested.
2023-12-13 Zhengle Xia[ST] IR responded. Additional logs collected with debug knife.
2023-12-12 SZajaczkowski [RFSW]: Still under investigation, additional IR has been sent.
2023-12-11 SZajaczkowski [RFSW]: IR responded, new logs under our check - LE: 12/12.

2023-12-06 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] TP still in the works, the status is to be synced on with dev to determine if LE: EoB is still valid due to complexity.
2023-12-05 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] TP to gather captures is in the works - LE: 6/12.
2023-11-30 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] Complex case - case to share with technical folks which have TDD knowledge. LE for conclusions: 1/12.
2023-11-28 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] Investigation is ongoing from our side, possible conclusions till EoB.
2023-11-24 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] No findings yet, as this case is complex - if no findings till today EoB still, we will review this case with our TLs/Archs on Monday 27/11.
2023-11-22 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] It has been clarified that draco behavior is expected, we are currently investigating it deeper, but the issue is complex (as we are unable to see what could be the problem at the first glance). Possible LE for next steps/findings: 24/11.
2023-11-21 Zhengle Xia[ST]: Found this 1907 issue in another AZQC radio 1M181801132. Logs collected:  \\nescrotta.nesc.nokia.net\rotta\MN_RAN\RAN_ST\24R2\New_Features\RAN_PZ_HAZ_4\SG08\CB010564-E\Issue\AZQC_1907\1907-1M181801132
2023-11-17 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] This case needs draco clarification regarding the differences in number of timing configurations. Probable answer 20/11.
2023-11-16 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] PR back to DAPD after IR - to be checked, LE: EoB.
2023-11-16 Zhengle Xia[ST]: IR324821 responded. OK logs provided.
2023-11-16 Jessica Zhang[RFSW]: debug IR is created，waiting for response，LE: open
2023-11-15 Jessica Zhang[RFSW]: new 1+1 nahka case, will check tomorrow
2023-11-15 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] The TDD configuration seems to be different between OK and NOK log - we are analyzing what is the root cause of such change, as from tester's POV the same SCF file is used.
2023-11-14 SZajaczkowski [RFSW] We have two suspicions to be checked today: 1. if this is the two SMODs scenario, which would point towards valid SW issue and would need deeper investigation in our case, 2. if it's not, then it is a suspected HW issue - IR in this case is to be sent.

2024-01-15 PnC: PnC expert had been looped and checking whether reqs needed to update.
2024-01-08 [joollank]: PET has started testing PR with latest 24R1 build
2024-01-04 [joollank]: PET is working with 24R2 new feature content at the moment
2023-12-21 [L2PS_BLR]: we see lot of delay and dtx for SR. Awaiting result for test done on simulator with 3-5 cells.
2023-12-20 [L2PS_BLR]: new test with starting one simulator only for 6 cell and still RLF then simulator in combination of (5+4) cell. Older IR log investigation ongoing.
2023-12-19 [L2PS_BLR]: IR response awaited for 1400 UE distributed across 9 cell. 
2023-12-18 [L2PS_BLR]: PR is not TOP1 blocker.
2023-12-15 [L2PS_BLR]: With Current analysis  PR737270_L2PS_Analysis 1.docx  , The Flood of WRN or ERR Prints is not visible now 
and Currently only 1 UE out of 1440 UE's has an RLF which is being investigated. 
2023-12-14 [L2PS_BLR]:  IR raised for 2 new configuration run discussed in yesterday's call.
2023-12-13 [L2PS_BLR]: CR was responded by cp-rt and from PET team we have got instance of earlier capacity test done for VoNR case and which will be analysed. Result of late run 9 cell + 1440 UE (order of UE Attach & More Delay b/w UE Groups) will be shared by tester today.
2023-12-12 [L2PS_BLR]: When UEs are evenly distributed across all cells then a core with two cell have huge amount of UEs to serve to in this case around (2 *144) 288. The core shows more frequently in load leading to gradual reduction of CS1 size and hence avg sched count.
2023-12-10 [joollank]: PET testing done.
2023-12-10 [joollank]: PET testing done for AP 1. and AP 2. AP 3; will be done morning of 11th december 
2023-12-10 [joollank]: PET testing ongoing with IR327704, LE 10th .december
== 2023-12-08 ==
[#Summary: ]
1. Sems that 1440 VONR UE capacity requirement not correct.
2. No conclusion on why schedule delay with MAX ~150ms, need L2-PS continuse investigation why. Logs shows that lots of CS2 blocking for lack of PDCCH and also DL RLC discared for delay too much.
3. No actions on L2-LO.
[#Next steps: ]
Double confirm with A&S if VONR UE capacity requirement not correct. 
-If yes, transfer PR to A&S.
-If no, transfer PR to L2-PS, because need L2-PS analysis results on the issues above.

== 2023-12-07 ==
[#Summary: ]
1. L2-PS investigation ongoing 1) why scheduler delay with MAX ~150ms and 2) CS2 blocking for lack of PDCCH
2. Viavi analysis not completed for logs not provided for server issue.
3. No actions on L2-LO.
[#Next steps: ]
1. Need L2-PS analysis results on the issues above, LE is 7th Dec, then decide more details on next step.
2. Wait Viavi feedback to confrim if any UL packets lost on UE side.

== 2023-12-06 ==
[#Summary: ]
1. L2-HI already confirmed that during the time ""RoHC decompression failed"" appears, meanwhile UL PDCP packets received are not continuous.
2. Viavi tacket already created, wait for response.
[#Next steps: ]
1. Wait Viavi feedback to confimr if any UL packets lost on UE side.
2. A&S feedback that ""the delay is so large packets will be discarded due to exceeding the 5QI discard timer."". Need L2-PS to check if schedule abnormal or not, also PDCCH configuration check ongoing.

== 2023-12-05 ==
[#Summary: ]
1. L2-LO received UL traffic data with some packets lost.
2. L2-HI already double confirmed that not every loss of PDCP packets must result in RoHC decompression failure. Logs analysis have confirmed that for several UEs during the time ""RoHC decompression failed"" appears, meanwhile UL PDCP packets received are not continuous (more analysis ongoing).
[#Next steps: ]
1. Need Vivian to check why UE send data with PDCP packet lost.
2. L2-PS already confirmed that UL packets scheduled in time. But ~100+ms between two different UL packet scheduled before and after for the same UE, need to be double confirmed. CR already sent to A&S.

== 2023-12-04 ==
[#Summary: ]
1. Analysis shows L2-LO trace lost during overload and prbobaly no packects dropped on platfrom side, new logs analysis still ongoing.
2. PDCP discard with 300ms not accepted, and L2-RT deployment number changed from 1 to 2.
[#Next steps: ]
1. Continue analyzing logs, double confirm if BIP message for UE with LCID =5 lost or not, to check if issue exists on UE side.
2. Sync with L2-HI components on logs analysis of two cases, few logs print during 1210 UEs attach and error flooding when 1440 UEs attached. TF meeting with PET and other components with new issues.

2023-12-02: L2-LO: analysis ongoing as so many new logs.
== 2023-12-01 ==
[#Summary: ]
Bsaed on the latest logs,
1. For ""RoHC decompression error"" not exsit with PDCP discard time value 300, it seems that is related to ~80 UEs with 5QI-1 bearer setup failuer.
2. UE capacity 1440 still can not reach, with ~4 UEs gap.
[#Next steps: ]
1. double confirm with PET if PDCP discard timer with 300ms can be accepted or not. If yes, request PET to test using former version with vlaue 300ms, and check if original issue ""RoHC decompression failed"" still exist or not.
2. Propose to use new PR(s) to track different issues. Discsuss with PET to confirm more testing details, e.g. SINR condition and if packet loss or low MOS exists. 
3. Continue analyzing logs, and discuss with other components on logs analysis and findings.

== 2023-11-30 ==
[#Summary: ]
1. Based on latest logs in IR326408, no RoHC error after PDCP discard time changed from 100ms to 200ms or 300ms. 2. UE capacity 1440 still can not reach, with ~4 UEs gap.
[#Next steps: ]
1. continue analyze logs. 2. sync with L2-PS and PET to discuss if enlarge PDCP time can be accepted or not. If not, may L2-PS provide part2 knfie. Also need L2-PS to check why so many error prints during RACH.

2023-11-29: L2-LO: request PET to re-test on 24R1 with L2-PS load balance correction part1 to check if the same root casue with PR732941. IR already sent and re-test ongoing. L2-LO already add some new debug information to confirm L2-LO trace lost or not, and a new knife building ongoing. Next step: 1. Check if the same RC with PR732941 after PET test results return. 2. sync with other componets any new finding and request PET to re-test using the new knife if not the same RC as PR732941.
2023-11-28: L2-LO: latest logs anlysis finished but BIP ccollected not sucessfully. Already host TF meeting with L2-HI, UPHWAPI, LFS. Next step: 1. Confirm if similar RC with PR732941, CR already sent to L2-PS for building 24R1 knife. 2. perpare more debug method for a new knife
2023-11-27: L2-LO: logs analysis ongoing. Next step: continue analyzing logs and sync with other components with abnormal founding.
2023-11-25: L2-LO: anlysis on new logs ongoing. Next step: After logs analysis on each component include L2-HI, L2-LO, UPHWAPI and LFS completed, need a meeting to sync findings between different component.

2023-11-24: Xiaoqi Guo: From the analysis, tcpdump collected period time from 09:45:4141 to 09:49:066251. This is not the time when the problem occurred, so L2 cannot prove that L1 sent the message.
And there is no any drop on UP side.
2023-11-24: Shunfeng Ma (NSB) The group in charge changed from ECE_DEV_CHZ_UP_L2_LO to BB_PSW_UPHWAPI. Reason for Transfer: 2-LO application anslysis shows BIP messages event lost during issue preiod.Refer to more deails in attachment. Need UPHWAPI check, 1.if some BIP message events are lost on RX side or not dispatched during the issue period. 2.UPHWAPI tried adding debug but failed twice, more debugging ongoing.

SBTS24R1 Correction form created base build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007)
[2023-11-23]: L2-LO: some events ulData_PuschReceiveRespLo lost based on L2-LO TTI trace, UPHWAPI is checking EMTrace logs. Next step: need UPHWAPI check if some events lost and why.
[2023-11-22]: L2-LO: A new knife include L2-LO/UPHWAPI EMTrace enable/L2-HI ready and IR already sent, waiting for retest. Analysis logs in IR325290 shows that NO PDCP discontinous on L2-LO side, but still ERROR print, also need L2-HI to check why. Next step: continue logs analysis when logs avaiable.
[2023-11-21]: L2-LO: Logs analysis onoging wiht knife with UPHWAPI trace enable already tested, seems UPHWAPI not valid. Next step: continue analyzing logs.
[2023-11-20]: L2-LO: Some BIP message uldata_puschreceiveresplo events are lost in L2-LO RX side during the issue period, and analysis shows that CPU overload at other time. Next step: 1. Need UPHWAPI to check if some BIP message events are lost or not handled on L2-LO RX side during high load, 2. Also need CB009215-SR-W A&S to confirm if the test scenario beyond the C&P requirements.
[2023-11-17]: L2-LO: UL PDCP data lost, as some UEs' PDCSP SN not continuous in TTT trace, but BIP logs shows PDCP SN continuous. Next step: check why PDCP lost in L2-LO, may build knife to check if UL data message not received in L2-LO or some issue during L2-LO handle
[2023-11-16]: L2-LO: New logs collected and analysis ongoing, PDCSP SN not continuous in TTT trace during issue period. BIP logs analysis ongoing duiring issue period. Next step: continue analyze logs.
[2023-11-15]: L2-LO : Wait new logs for IR. Continue analysis on legacy logs, but no big progress.
2023-11-15: Xuejun-Sheehan Chen (NSB) Problem attached to PR735575.
 2023-11-14 L2HI TD:  Analysis ongoing of the new set of logs which arrived in the IR response.
 2023-11-13 L2HI TD: Retest needed focused on covering same timewindow for snapshot logs and DCAP data to proceed full analysis of rntis related to CRC failures

2024-01-02 Yang Bu. problem reproduced in RD local lab and we've get the required register dump as SOC connectivity required. Pronto now transferred to SOC connectivity for further investigating.
2023-12-25 Anji Li [RFSW] Unit is on the way to Nanjing since 2023-12-24. Check the state on https://www.dhl.com/nl-en/home/tracking/tracking-express.html?submit=1&tracking-id=1562847893

2023-12-21 Yang Bu [RFSW] As discussed in teams chat, unit will be shipped to RD site for further investigating
2023-12-20 recovery reboot cannot be disabled in L3 env, we are discussing ship the unit to local RD site to continue investigating
2023-12-19: still have problem in LMI using and DisableReboot method. now confirming and discussing next step with tester. 
2023-12-15:pryzner IR responded: Collecting logs is not possible because another issue appeard. New logs were delivered to development group via  teems chat
2023-12-15 IR ongoing and problem not reproduced yet.
2023-12-14 waiting IR response
2023-12-13 tester has got LMI card and started to work on IR.
2023-12-12 raised IR to the action of collect register dump
2023-12-11 will check with tester any progress in getting LMI card today. If case would still be blocked by this, we will suggest shipping unit back to RD site and postponed the case during the shipment. 
2023-12-08 waiting confirmation from tester, LE 1211
2023-12-07 HW team still need analysis from SOC so we need to get register dump in L3 env. since when problem being reproduced in L3 env, RU will be reset by BTS, then LMI card is needed in this operation. tester is checking whether LMI card is available.  
2023-12-06 HW group request soc to prove it's a HW issue so we transferred the pronto to soc while soc cannot do it. Case is obviously a HW issue due to 
1). problem only seen in one unit, by replacing the HW unit problem can be solved.
2). problem only seen after power on reset and can always be resolved by SW reset, indicating some there may be some problem in MADE power on sequence, and RFSW doesn't control the power on sequence at all. RFSW control the SW reset procedure which is actually never causes this problem. 
Will transfer to HW group next step.
2023-12-05 MPe: Question to soc was: ""please soc team check whether any evidence can be found to prove it's a HW issue.""You have your answer. Provide register dumps where RP2ETH_TSER interrupt is showing up.
2023-11-29: KKj: This case has been transferred to RF side and then back to SoC team, as RFSW thinks that WA cannot be applied. RFSW experts have discussed with HW, but their analysis cannot convince HW team, thus they propose SoC to confirm it's a HW issue.
2023-11-24: KKj: SoC SW analysis now prepared (see attached).
2023-11-23: KKj: In PR675029 case, the unit was tested with tadx env (R&D site) - ETH_EN toggling resolved the issue (known as it was possible to control the message length). In this new case, it may be difficult to check whether the 'ETH_EN toggling' -action can be effective - the package losing only happened when long soap message being sent, while in L3 test line the soap message length cannot be controlled.
2023-11-21: KKj: IR Responded - The problem reproduced with AWHKB radio (S/N: EB2316R0656), when port2 in use.
2023-11-20 Reporting Portal: FOT changed to No as Feature is Done/Feature cannot be found in Fusion
2023-11-20: KKj: Waiting for IR Response - The request is to collect connectivity rp3 register dumper output (""dump-rp3-regs"" executable) from the problem, to see whether the same RP2ETH_TSER interrupt is happening there. 
2023-11-17: KKj: RF colleagues state that a similar issue (PR675029) was seen one year ago, which is an occasion HW issue that caused Ethernet package losing. The reproduce rate is usually 1/3 in a certain radio when power down and Up, and will automatically gone with one more sw reset. In both PR737224 and PR675029 cases
- RU is based on Made1 
- We see same long package losing inside Made chip when power down/up unit, while never reproduced in SW reset 
2023-11-17 problem reponed that investigating should be continue. Since it's same case PR675029 in RFSW perspective, we will transfer this PR to SOC team  to analysis the 'long package losing' issue inside MADE.
2023-11-16, MedynskaMarta: broken hw issue cnned as fnr in sw, FC was informed that it is incorrect
2023-11-13 yangb [RFSW] tester was OoO last Friday, will continue discuss today 
2023-11-10 yangb [RFSW] Problem cannot be reproduced after replacing RU (80 attempts),  while in previous broken radio the reproduce ratio was about 1/3. So it should be same case as PR675029 we met 1 year ago, which was a single HW failure case. Since SW cannot check such issue further and HW PME will also analyzing single HW broken, we are suggesting CNN this case as FNR.
2023-11-09 yangb [RFSW] waiting IR response
2023-11-08 yangb [RFSW] similar case as PR675029 which is an occasion HW issue that caused Ethernet package losing, the reproduce rate is usually 1/3 in a certain radio when power down and Up, and will automatically gone with one more sw reset. To confirm this a IR raised to replace the AWHKB HW  to confirmed whether it's a HW issue or not.

2024-01-05 S. Räty there are actions from yesterday TF which are under clarification. Clarification will continue on Monday because of the bank holiday
2024-01-04 S. Räty because SFP HW is refusing the transfer we will have meeting today and try to clarify the issue. Next steps after the call
2024-01-02 Arkadiusz Bentkiewicz:In SW team we don't see possibility to continue with the findings we have. We ask HW SFP Team for refer to the analysis and findings
2023-12-29 ostojic:further clarification with HW SFP Team ongoing about further pronto handling and transfer to their group is not acceptable, as their expert is off till 02.01 to check more latest findings;

2023-12-22 Arkadiusz Bentkiewicz: New analysis upload. Please move Pronot to HW SFP Team.
2023-12-21/22 Arkadiusz Bentkiewicz: The problem reproduces on all test sets.It seems that the SFP, after applying this specific attenuation, synchronizes with the optical signal but it is inappropriate for the Harrier port. 
2023-12-19/20ostojic: additional debugging and inv ongoing by LFS expert and test team;

2023-12-13 jpiltone:
what is actually surprising is ""[ASIM][104][ABIO][AKNB] ASIM EIF1 with AOSO 102 does not recover  after removing RX  power low warning condition"" is that the situation is not getting better when they remove the attenuation. At that moment, we should get understanding of the signal quality if it is really good enough, and then I suppose that if its autonegotiated mode vendor should explain if AN is supposed to start over again or if it must be triggered by TRSW.

2024-01-11 [RF_SFS]: waiting for the agreement and decision for the correction in between the interested stakeholders;
2024-01-10 [RF_SFS]: solution proposal given, under evaluation:1. RFSW sends the old RSSI report. or 2. 2. CBRS SW does not raise fault in the case that enhance RSSI measurement failed, uses the old RSSI report it stores.
2024-01-08 [RF_SFS]: RF_SW to find out the responsibility for CBRS SFS; 
2024-01-05 [RF_SFS]: discussion on going - no solution as LTE3974 is under CBRS which does not exists and CP2 approved more than 5 years;
2024-01-04 [RF_SFS]: possible solution discussed with RFSW;
2024-01-02 [RF_SFS]: searching for CBRS SFS responsibility;
2023-12-22 [RF_SFS]: checking with Small Cell Expert why the CFAM restriction has not been implemented;
2023-12-20 [RF_SFS]: solution under discussion; CuDo update should be ok;
2023-12-15 Kristiina Eade [RF A&S] restriction in CFAM/CuDo or new feature?
2023-12-12 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] limitation for RF, need clarification from A&S team. LE: 2023-12-12
2023-12-11 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] it is confirmed this is limitation for RF, so we need clarification from A&S team. LE: 2023-12-11
2023-12-08 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] For sure we do not utilize all DFE channels, but there are more restrictions in DFE. One would be AxC channels which would be depleted for 4xLTE20 configuration, but for those special measurement carriers we should not allocate any AxC channel. next action: will point out the key point and let Pawel Jakubowski (Nokia) comment again about how to solve this issue. LE: 2023-12-08

2023-12-07 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] we have sent a request to arch for help, today I think arch will assigned for this case. LE: 2023-12-07
2023-12-06 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] need continue to confirm with arch expert. LE: 2023-12-06
2023-12-05 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] from this pronto, AZQC can't support this scenario, because there is HW resource limitation. next action: need confirmation with arch expert. LE: 2023-12-05
technical status: 
From our radio control point view, the PreTxMeasurement failed due to channel unavailable, i thought that the detail reason was ""There are 4 LTE 20M Rx Carriers configured on one antenna, next PreTxMeasurement measurement soap is sent, it wants to create a empty.LTE.preTxMeasurement Rx carrier (LTE 10M Rx Carrier) on this antenna, then it is rejected by ""CHANNEL_UNAVAILABLE""(the full oBW of this antenna is utilized). At last, preTxMeasurement is failure.""   But from CBRS’s PoV, CBRS could trigger the enhanced measurement in this situation. The reason was ""When CBRS receive the SAS response Code 501 and cell grant state change from Authorized to granted, will trigger the measurement with transmissionInterruptionAllowed mode, it meets the requirement of enhanced measurement.
And regarding the OBW limitation of measurement, we could found below description in LTE3974-24 :
""If operator configures maximum number of carriers per pipe (4 carriers with 20 MHz bandwidth), RF SW is able to perform the RSSI measurement (set-up empty measurement carrier in UL). In this particular configuration, all available antenna containers on DFE IF will be consumed but there will be still some free DFE channels left to run the measurement.""""
 

2023-12-04 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] when CBRS sent, RF reject due to no resource, RF spec think it is right, but BOAM think it do not meet the BOAM spec. next action: need RF spec and IDT clarification. LE: 2023-12-05

2023-12-01 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] In OK scenario, when CBRS message sent, resource is ready, so result is success. next action: will have a comparison of the OK and NOK scenario. LE: 2023-12-01
2023-11-30 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] IR is responded, seems no CBRS message in the runtime log in OK scenario. next action: will check soap whether there is CBRS message sent. LE: 2023-11-30

2023-11-29 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] IR is responded, log will be checked, next action: will discuss with arch about the right behavior and will check whether spec is aligned with fact. LE: 2023-11-29
2023-11-28 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] checking whether RF SPEC is aligned to this PR scenario or not. next action: will sent IR to get OK log to compare. LE: 2023-11-28

2023-11-11 Tang yilong: [RFSW]created team chat, need RUMAG and Draco expert confirm the obw limit
2023-11-09 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] The oBW limit was 80MHz for one pipe (one antenna), four LTE 20MHz Rx carriers as below were configured on antenna1a, the full oBW of antenna1a was utilized. Next the PreTxMeasurement measurement soap sent, there was no resource to allocate new empty Rx carrier (empty.LTE.preTxMeasurement) for the measurement, then PreTxMeasurement failed.  next action: need to check ""why the PreTxMeasurement measurement soap is sent when four LTE 20MHz Rx carriers have been configured on one antenna"".

2023-11-09 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] we have confirmed that this failure is normal. next action: need UOAM to check why preTXmeasurement is sent, because below resource is not enough to handle it. LE: 2023-11-09
2023-11-08 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] transaction failed; it is due to resource shortage, need to check further whether it is normal or not, if this failure of this transaction is expected, PR will transfer back to UOAM domain. next action: need confirm this assumption with soap message. LE: 2023-11-08
2023-11-07 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] seems OBW value is bigger than the range which lead to transaction failed, need to check further why OBW value is bigger than the range. LE: 2023-11-07
2023-11-06 Weiyi Ying: [RFSW] fresh case, checking. LE: 2023-11-06

2023-12-07 LX: RNL SFS+ NIDD proposed for review. LE:Dec.11
2023-12-07 Radek Papke  / L1: WA delivery from OAM/NTS team for 24R1 branch done. Waiting verification from PET and feedback about proper SFS group to handle that case forward. SFS person was offline, therefore PR is parked for one more day in L1Low. 
2023-12-05 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] Had TF meeting. Agreed that OAM will add correction form for the WA already committed, then asking for lowering the top flagging. Also agreed that PR needs to be transferred to SFS level for defining new NIDD parameter in the specification. Finding out the correct group.
2023-12-05 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] L1low cannot do anything for this PR, no other team willing to accept transfer. Called a TF meeting for early Tuesday to discuss the case.
2023-12-04 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] There is nothing L1low can do to solve this PR. Discussing in Teams on the correct owner of the PR, then transfer.
2023-12-01 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] Had TF meeting. Agreed that PR transferred to  5G_SPEC_UP_L2RT_ARCH team who will continue to study the issue. Will ask if WE OT could be skipped as 1) we now have WA via parameters 2) it is unlikely that the case would happen in the field (20 UEs 20m from RU)
2023-12-01 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] Testing done with suggested parameters, test would pass with the changed values. Now need to understand why MACPS is not scope of this +12db power difference between 23R4 and 24R1. Asking to add SFS team into investigation. Called a meeting for today. L2-ps should continue with investigation.
2023-12-01 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] L1low analysis added. W4 new logs (LE Friday). W4 L2-ps to comment on what what causes CLPC to lose control. Suggesting transfer to L2-ps, L1low not able to study further. 
2023-11-30 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] Product architect suspecting that CLPC is disturbed by random high UL power, dragging the system into dead lock of power rising if some UE has experienced power saturation caused SINR  degradation. Analysis received also from RAN A&S: something causing losing control of power, reason for this not known yet. Next : L2-PS could help to investigate what causes CLPC to lose control. If no SW bug, correction needs to be specified by L2 RT ARCH.
2023-11-29 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] IQ data received and analysed. Seems too much power used for both releases testings. L1low we cannot do much, l1low is working as specified and uses values received from baseband/uoam. Next: to be checked by L2-PS if closed loop algo working as expected, is it requesting UE power correctly with currently used settings. Also to be checked if test setup correct/optimal from power point of view as there is seen way too much power? Contacting FOT leader in order to check if testing parameters are correct.
2023-11-28 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] Meeting held with L1low, A&S and testing. Latest status shared and agreed that link to IQ captures for failing 24R1 to be shared by PR author. Next steps to be agreed after analysing IQ data.
2023-11-28 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] case is related to feature CB010765 and it is implemented like specified. Involving A&S, if we have now one RU (Galvatron) which is not working with specified values. Calling a meeting for today. Requesting for IQ data.
2023-11-27 Hailong Ye [RFSW]: we have found one suspicious code submission, and made a knife, after knife verification, we suspect that this is guilty submission which inject this issue, and we have added L1low expert for further check for this submission and take next action. LE: 2023-11-27

2023-11-26 Hailong Ye [RFSW]  finding the guilty version ongoing. We still need 5 versions to locate the guilty domain.  next action: between these problematic versions, we found one suspicious L1low's code submission, maybe this is the code submission which inject this issue, and we have prepared one knife to verify our conjecture.

2023-11-25 Hailong Ye [RFSW]  1. finding the guilty version ongoing.  The next version is the version between SBTS00_ENB_9999_230819_000020 and SBTS00_ENB_9999_230821_000016, and the version between SBTS00_ENB_9999_230816_000007 and SBTS00_ENB_9999_230816_000014. because we find the BLER have dramatic change between these versions. 2. from the log, we didn't find any new clue, and ADI vendor also have no new finding. LE: EOB 2023-11-27

2023-11-24 Hailong Ye [RFSW]  This problem only occurs when multiple UEs are accessed at the same time under the condition of UE open-loop power control. next action:  1. continue to find out the guilty version using dichotomy way. 2. dump information is sent to TRX team and TRX team have sent to ADI for check. 3. capture the snapshot log when issue happened, and to find any clue for this issue. LE: EOB 2023-11-24

2023-11-22 Hailong Ye [RFSW] 1. need to find out the guilty version using dichotomy way. 2. will prepare the tool to capture the dump information and send it to TRX team to have a check. because from our perspective, the signal from the Palau is already very big, need Palau expert to give us explanation. LE: EOB 2023-11-24

2023-11-21 Hailong Ye [RFSW] seems this issue is not related with CB010765. next action: we need to confirm from which 24R1 version have this issue using dichotomy.  LE: EOB 2023-11-24

2023-11-19 Hailong Ye [RFSW] W4IR, the test line in the lab was powered off due to COSI's notice mail, there was no power in lab during this weekend. LE: EOB 2023-11-20
2023-11-18 Hailong Ye [RFSW] The power is abnormally high in normal streaming scenario + L2PS CLPC (closed loop power control ).  This high UL power is from UE transmission which can be increased by L2 resource schedule via CLPC. L2 expert think this unexpected result is caused by the RF internal high noise. From the power level picture when UE detach, we can see a few occasional high power signal. It is hard to know where below beating high power comes from. and they are also present on 23R3 on which test is OK. So, we think there is any other reason resulting in the issue. next step: IR is sent to let PR author to find out the first bad gNB package.  LE: EOB 2023-11-20

2023-11-16 Chris Huang [RFSW] issue reproduced, log is under checking, suspect noise is too high, but we RF didn't find such problem, we need to check further why UE power pushed too high. LE: 2023-11-17

2023-11-15 :  Zhou Chunying:
- Checked 23R3 latest build testing result, there is very fewer power jump than 24R1.
- Will ask RF expert to check further about the noise power issue firstly.
2023-11-14 :  Zhou Chunying:
- Checked the logs withou UE connection, still have big power visible in RRU draco logs, PR will be moved to RRU side to check further.
2023-11-13 :  Zhou Chunying:
- From RRU knife, there is still high signal power visible in RU logs, CLPC is worse than OLPC, continue discussing with L1Low and RU expert about this case.
2023-11-11 :  Zhou Chunying:
- From RRU POV, PALAU 1.8 can cause big noise, RF will provide one knife to verify if it's this issue. 
2023-11-10 :  Zhou Chunying:
- Checked the logs again, noise power and rxpower increased at the same time, will check with L2/Shu Gang if related with CLPC.
- Will check CLPC + disable Cell 2 logs about the power if normal.
2023-11-09 :  Zhou Chunying:
- From current logs, seems this issue is not related with CLPC, continue checking logs for the trigger that noise power increase so big.
- Is asking tester to provide logs with OLPC in 24R1 with cell stationary. LE: 11.9
2023-11-08 :  Zhou Chunying:
- Will check the logs with fixed station again, if this issue is related with CLPC in BIP logs. LE: 11.8
- Will ask 5gmax help to check and confirm if it's real big signal received by ULPHY. LE: 11.8
2023-11-07 :  Zhou Chunying:
- From tester side, 23R3 logs not cover the testing scenario, will retest 23R3 and provide new logs today.
-  Compared SCF parameters, found many parameters are different between 23R3 and trunk, will discuss with tester if can disable trunk new parameters and align with 23R3 to check if issue introduced by these new parameters.
2023-11-06 :  Shi Yongjun/Li Ping: 
- Continue double checking current logs deeply to double confirm current findings.
- Will check if tester can set 2 cells in AEHB and 1 cell in AQHA to run, and check the testing result.
- Will provide one knife with 03374447 correction code in 23R3, to check the noise power.
2023-11-05: [l1low] L1 analysis is based on L1 debug knife + CLPC disable, asked author to retest it with official build with CLPC disable and without HOs, then check the result.
below is some basic test result from tester view:
1) CLPC disable, then ok, CLPC enable, the issue visible.
2) the L1 knife is valid for cell1, not valid in cell2, cell1 and cell2 in same AQHA.
3) from UP-analyzer, the noise power is ok, but bip not matched with UP-analyzer?
2023-11-04 :  Shi Yongjun/Li Ping: 
- Checked IQ data and bip logs, there is big noise power sent to ULPHY, need RRU/L1Low to check further. 
2023-11-03 :  Shi Yongjun/Li Ping: 
- IQ data analyzed, l1sw is matched with 5gmax, but noise power is still very big(~-50dBm), will double confirm and give final result.. LE: 11.3
2023-11-02 :  Shi Yongjun/Li Ping: 
- IQ data provided, will check today.
2023-11-01 :  L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_HZH: 
- Knife tested, KPI still not recovered as before, is asking tester to provide new logs with IQ data to check further.
2023-10-31 :  L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_HZH: Suspect the same as 03338743. Will provide one possible correction knife to check if KPI has any improvement. LE: 10.31

We collect next all techsupport logs from both nok and ok case for Broadcom and then open a ticket to them to check differences that may be related to the issue.
2024-01-11 Timo Koskinen: The testing is still ongoing, sometimes it takes time to reproduce the issue in the lab.
2024-01-10 Timo Koskinen: No new findings and idea about RC yet, testing in lab continues today.
2024-01-09 Timo Koskinen: Testing in lab still in progress, the earlier knife didn't work and I had to prepare a new one yesterday.
2024-01-08 Timo Koskinen:  No new findings yet. We are trying to get investigation forward and next step clarified today.
2024-01-08 S. Räty no new findings still investigating deeper and trying to find solution LE?
2024-01-05 S. Räty We are still testing this SW Testability fix in the lab where the GDPLL lock issue has occurred to study its effect more. Still needs some days to finish LE?
2024-01-04 S. Räty seems we cannot fix this in LFS BBB side, correction what we tried are failing. Now we are asking help from LFS testability if they have ideas how to fix this LE for the comments 4.1 or 8.1 depending the que
2024-01-03 S. Räty some finding from the failure logs but still need more investigation. LFS BBB part also involved.
2024-01-02 S. Räty IR responded, correction knife failed. Timo Koskinen is checking the logs.
2023-12-29 Garstka: new IR raised to collect logs with correction knife
2023-12-28 Timo Koskinen: No time for this yesterday due to another urgent Pronto. I'll try to start preparing the knife today. This is a fix proposal knife.
2023-12-27 Timo Koskinen: Next new knife is prepared where the bmux data collection delay made to PR739485 is still increased
2023-12-25/26 MonicaZhang: On-hold as developer bank holiday
2023-12-22 Timo Koskinnen: I'll take over this case due to Heikki's holiday. I need to look into the problem: I'm still looking into this, maybe a new knife is needed, where the bmux data collection delay made to PR739485 is still increased
2023-12-21: Heikki.1.Autio: Slave side GDPLL locking fails again. Timer triggers after 2.5s and re remove and rebuild the GDPLL channel correctly but it does not help. GDPLL locking the next port is working fine but as one port failed - 1811 and recovery reboot.

2023-12-08: Heikki.1.Autio: 2 different kind of errors: silent GDPLL failure, DPLL-Large error callback from Monterey and error returned from Monterey when creating GDPLL channel. Support from France LFS Networking needed as they have check if RP1 GDPLL channel needs to be re-done even before trying to lock. Maybe we need the same?
2023-12-08 Petar Barac In checked logs it seems that some error exist with GDPLL creation(SW issue)
2023-12-07 Petar Barac Logs after swap provided.Expecting analysis of logs during day.
2023-12-06 Petar Barac Expecting results from retest after swap of ASIL boards(probably today).Further work(checking of new logs) will be continued tomorrow due to public holiday in Finland so developer is OoO today.
2023-12-05 Petar Barac Swap done, retest will be done during night.
2023-12-05 Petar Barac Swap of ASIL boards requested via IR.Expecting results from author after swap.In mean time ongoing discussion with SPEC side for suprressing of FID:1811 in this situation.
2023-12-04 Mtomala: Author were requested to 1) swap the to ASILs or 2) try newer branch, SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_231127_000015 for example. Developer suspects that the secondary ASIL HW might be faulty. LE:04.12 TBC
2023-12-01: [Krzysztof Gomulec] IR326698 responded. Logs from retest with debug knife will be checked today.
2023-11-30 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: I get more instructions from BCom  and I believe that I will have the knife made soon.
2023-11-29 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: Some delay due to problems getting the LFS code to be compiled with the BCom patch. Debug knife should be ready today - with this BCom patch we're trying to find out what is causing delay in the port enabling.
2023-11-28 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: I just started preparing correction knife, LE 30.11.
2023-11-27 [LFS BBB] Saju Singh: there is similar problem in other compoents that uses BCom interfaces, i discussed with C&S, they have delay issue but NOT with this ""bcm_port_resource_multi_set"" function that we have So I suggest Timo to create different ticket to BCom for discussion for this issue. 
2023-11-24 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: Pending BCom feedback (no LE yet). Meantime we discussed this at our LFS BBB meeting and Saju was also going to start checking this problem.
2023-11-23 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: I received first response from Bcom. Similar delay problem in the bcm_port_resource_multi_set function has already been reported by someone else and they suspect that the delay in the function is due to the priority with which tasks get execution time, but there is no certainty about that yet. The investigation continues from BCom side.
2023-11-22/21 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: We can't find the reason for the problem in our own implementation.  We're contacting Broadcom why it's taking so long to enable th port. Estimate for BCom feedback: 22.11. 
2023-11-20 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: Pending Heikki Autio comment. 
2023-11-17 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: I couldn't get this reproduced in my target environment.
We then discussed this in our LFS BBB meeting and came to the conclusion that we have to wait until next Monday until Heikki Autio comes to work.  Heikki knows this area best and can say what to do next, whether the problem can be caused by our changes or whether we need to contact Bradcom.
2023-11-16 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: Testing in own target still ongoing, no new findings
2023-11-15 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: It is still not clear where the problem is, I need to try to reproduce the problem on our own test target next to investigate this futher.
2023-11-14 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: IR324388 responded - according to these new debug logs, it seems that Broadcom function bcm_port_resource_multi_set takes more than 6 seconds, which is why the OBSAI link creation fails with the timeout. I need to talk to our ASIL experts if they see any reason or if we need to contact Broadcom.
2023-11-13 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: It seems that some Broadcom function takes more than five seconds and therefore the Obsai link creation fails. I made a new knife with added logs so that we could find out this problematic function.  IR324388 sent, LE: EOB. 
2023-11-10 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: Knife failed and fault was now slightly different from the original and I am now trying to find the reason for it.
2023-11-09 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: Prepared new correction knife and send via  IR324113. LE for response: EOB.  
2023-11-08 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: Investigation of logs from retest is still ongoing, seems to be slightly different problem.
2023-11-07 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: IR323695 replied - correction knife failed. Logs from retest to be checked. 
2023-11-06 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: I now have a plan on how to recover from the DPLL-Large-Error and have started the correction knife implementation. LE for correction knife delivery: EOB. 
2023-11-03 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: It is not yet clear what exactly to do with this, I need to discuss it with the ASIL experts
2023-11-02 [LFS BBB] Timo Koskinen: I will start checking this today.
2023-10-31: [Krzysztof Gomulec] Due to Aimo's sick - on hold due to  PR736241 (human resources problem).
2023-10-30 [LFS BBB] Aimo Raasakka:  This is not the same as as PR718588/PR718260+others. There is GDPLL lock failing due to DPLL-large-error. Clock&Sync have fix to similar case. We need study if Clock&Sync approach can be used in this case.
2023-10-27: [Krzysztof Gomulec] Looks to be same as PR718588 + attahced ones. To be confirmed.

2023-12-01 J.Moilanen/PET2 LE for IR results Monday 4.12
2023-11-30 Maciej Rudek: Yesterday the tester didn't perform a test because the testline was blocked. Recent logs didn't contain any data after catching event rvindex = 2. This was probably done incorrectly by the tester. New instructions have been sent to the tester to collect data correctly. Awaiting new IQ data.  LE: 30/11/2
2023-11-29 Maciej Rudek: Recent logs didn't contain any data after event rvindex = 2 capture. This was probably done incorrectly by the tester. New instructions have been sent to the tester to collect data correctly. Waiting for new IQ data.  LE: 30.11.23 
2023-11-28 Maciej Rudek: New set of IQ samples has been received with set event rvindex = 2. New logs need to be investigated. LE: 29.11.23 
2023-11-27 Maciej Rudek:
L2 checked that we have BLER again
L1SW doesn't see any suspicious UEs in the IQ samples, 
Next step: check BIP logs LE: 28/11/23
We are looking for more information on the RRC release,
2023-11-24 Maciej Rudek:
There are new logs for the required SW. Viavi sent the EU list with RNTI for SR MAX exceeded.
1. Part of the analysis has been done on the L1HW side. LE 27.11.23
2. L2 is checking the sent UEs for BLER. LE 27.11.23
3. We are waiting for an answer from Viavi: if the EU will get RRC release. LE 28.11.23
2023-11-23 Maciej Rudek: Viavi provided a list of RNTI's that failed, L2 did not find BLER on these RNTI's, L1HI in IQ samples do not show BLER, it was not found in BIPLOG's either. The tester has changed SW versions between the last runs. The new IR will be sent for testing on the previous SW version and the same configuration. LE 24.11.23
2023-11-22 Maciej Rudek: According to Viavi's analysis, they got a different rank than they expected.  L2PS need to check what is the value of the rank sent in the request. This issue is also being analysed by the 5GMax team. This issue needs to be discussed at the TF meeting. LE 23.11.23
2023-11-21 Maciej Rudek: The TF meeting will start today. The investigation is still going on. The problems for 3 slots have been found. LE 22.11.23 
2023-11-20 Maciej Rudek: A new IQ sample collection must be performed with blind capture when the snapshot is triggered after rvIndex has been set to 1. Instructions have been sent to the Analyzer. LE 21.11.2023
2023-11-17 DLPHY: L1 IQ analysis ongoing, some slots have corrupted constellation, L1 debug ongoing, 5gmax analysis ongoing LE for next feedback 17.11.2023
16-11-2023: Vivavi analysis done, the issue is not the same than ticket W013854, next step is on L1 side
15-11-2023: sebtan L2PS: issue seems very similar to vaivi ticket W013854 - PR719026. Waiting for Viavi or L1 feedback to decide whether we can CNN it or not
14-11-2023 J:Moilanen/PET2 IR waiting for Viavi response, currently no LE provided.
13-11-2023: sebtan L2PS
Unusual 98% DL BLER for UE regarding issue 3. Ask L1 colleagues to help us check the cause of this BLER
10-11-2023: sebtan L2PS
Current CCL
Issue is compose of several issues:
1- Viavi parameter flag being wrongly set, leading to BWP switch issue
2- UE not receiving ReleaseCommand but somehow the release procedure went OK from gnb side = we're missing pcaps to investigate further
3- GNB not receiving RRCReconfigurationComplete, leading to UE being released on gnb side, but UE is not considered released on its side 
4- UE losing UL suddenly
5- Whole Viavi - All UEs dropping suddenly and all going DTX
Issue 2-3 might be similar, because UE doesn't understand that it has been released by GNB

Next steps:
Viavi side to check issue 2-3 in logs 231109
Viavi side to check issue 5 in logs 231106-231107-IR3

09-11-2023 As SR MAX Retrans ocurrences decreased drastically after Viavi parameter flag was fixed, we're currently investigating leftovers issues.
Meeting planned tomorrow to discuss these leftover issues, that seem to come from Viavi
08-11-2023: sebtan L2PS: Original issue is visible according to Viavi side, but not present on pcaps/tti traces. Waiting for new traces with whole run covered by pcaps to investigate further
07-11-2023: Original issue not seen anymore on new logs with all UEs, CNN candidates
06-11-2023: sebtan L2PS: 231106 set of logs received. BWP switch issue not seen.
Waiting for Viavi's feedback about RNTI 41546, sfn/slot 644/5, timestamp around 11:19:13,8813, on 231106 set of logs. BWP switch is successful on this UE. Whole Viavi UL seems to drop at same time. 
02-11-2023: P. VallÃ©e L2PS: answer Viavi about questions on rnti=18336; still waiting for UE side answer on this rnti
31-10-2023: sebtan L2PS: still waiting for UE side answer. Other RNTIs with similar symptoms:
RNTI 31784, sfn/slot 404/13 (feedback 405/4), timestamp (around 40:36.61)
Rnti 44664, sfn/slot 57/13 (timestamp 40:33,13)
30-10-2023: sebtan L2PS: Currently checking new logs. Following RNTI 18336, sfn 514- slot 2-14 where bwp switch to PS BWP is happening. Considered successful from GNB pov because non_dtx feedback is received. DTX phase happen right after.
Next step should be to check why UE didn't manage to switch
30.10.2023: J.Moilanen PET2 Still waiting for Viavi logmask, testing blocked until we get that. IR LE 30.10 EOB
27-10-2023: sebtan L2PS: According to traces, The instantaneous power from coma data is around the srsPowerThresholdForDlBm, which will trigger fallback from DFT to PMI beams. SSB beams will be used to send DCI/PDCCH because 0x580421 rdDisableBestPmiBeamForPdcch and 
0x580434  rdDisableBestSrsBeamForPdcch are set to default value 1. L2PS works as expected from 8247 pov.
Next step should be to check DCI reception on UE side
26-10-2023: sebtan L2PS: involving 8247 L2PS expert to check those points:
- Can failure on DL Beam switch from DFT to PMI induce DCI reception issue on UE side ?
- is DL Beam switch from DFT to PMI done correctly for those RNTI ? RNTI 8418 (timesteamp around 45:57,814), RNTI 58506, RNTI 37668
Checking currently ongoing
26-10-2023: J.Moilanen PET2 Currently waiting for Viavi to provide log mask. LE for IR results 27.10.
25-10-2023: sebtan L2PS:
- SRS behaviour is normal, no Resp is expected if UE is not in sumimo struct in srsreq
- DTX seems to appear when DLbeam is switching from DFT to PMI. Maybe DL beam issue lead to DCI not being received by UE and thus lead to DTX on UL ?  Need Ue side to Check DCI reception on UE side before and after Beam switch from DFT to PMI
24-10-2023: sebtan L2PS: 
- RNTI 8418 seems to have beam switch issues, need UE logs to confirm
- Can't check if this behaviour is specific or general behaviour, as lots of TTI traces are lost
- For this UE, SRSReceiveReq got unanswered for at least 10 sec (although UE was still answering PUSCH during this period) because of difference in programmed structures. Need SRS experts to check if this behaviour is normal or not

2023-12-01 SPu: Summary from 1.12 debugs:
 
If only S1 / LTE transmission link was cut - there was no module failure alarm issue detected.  S1 link failure was detected but this does not necessarily trigger the issue.
 
If GSM transmission link was cut  - there was no module failure alarm detected - and actually GSM carrier stayed configured on the radio all along.
 
 
-
When cutting both LTE and GSM transmission links there was potential for the 1907 issue. 
In all of the GAIA register dumps collected - when 1907 / module failure had occurred, always the alarm;
 
IF_BB_DL/ALARM_INTERRUPT3_STAT - WCDMA/LTE/GSM channel could be out of synch because of sequentially missed RP3 messages, channel #0
 
was set.
 
This means GSM had missing RP3 messages. When issue was not on despite cutting transmission links, this alarm was not active.
 
- Proposal for workaround;
 
Perform RU reset based on condition;
Radio alarm ""EFaultId_Tx_OutOfOrder (1136)""  being on.  / feedback level = -inf
+ IF_BB_DL/ALARM_INTERRUPT3   detected for the GSM carrier.
 
Question to RFSW; are these alarms handled & how?
IF_BB_DL/ALARM_INTERRUPT0_STAT - Missing message detected at channel #0
IF_BB_DL/ALARM_INTERRUPT1_STAT  - Buffer overflow detected at channel #0
IF_BB_DL/ALARM_INTERRUPT2_STAT - No frame boundary/timeslot0 message detected in capture window for channel #0
IF_BB_DL/ALARM_INTERRUPT3_STAT - WCDMA/LTE/GSM channel could be out of synch because of sequentially missed RP3 messages, channel #0
 
All of these can be seen on the error condition, but ALARM_INTERRUPT3_STAT being always on when issue met.
2023-11-30 SPu: We managed to take 1st captures with the issue on.
DPD input data seems not to be fine, stream is corrupted before dpd.
Without UE traffic on the LTE, no alarms occured when doing the link breaks.
Next: Try to collect GAIA register dump from NOK case and OK case to see are there some errors in GAIA datapath before the DPD.

2023-11-29 SPu: SoC team working on getting the telnet/ftp connection to RU. GAIA ASIC access is already working.
Adc fill level was constant throughout the test,
multiple link breaks to S1 -- the 1st break makes the sync switch from Top-Phase - GPS -- and GPS comes from system module. later on the GPS stays persistently as sync source. Issue does not occur on the 1st link break, this time it occurred on the 2nd break, which lasted 98sec.
LTE transmission link:   12*50sec link break + 50sec link connected  - no issue.
2023-11-28 SPu: Summary:
Problematic radio is not using JESD based FB ADC, but instead parallel ADC interface
Problem can be triggered after long optical connection break
This could indicate that there is either drift or a glitch in radio clocks
This could cause parallel ADC clock domain crossing fifo problem and that could cause incorrect feedback data in DAPD
Next actions:
We could monitor parallel ADC fifo by polling fifo fill level during optical fiber break
This can be done from by reading register
2023-11-27 SPu: Looking for SoC expertise with GAIA DPD & S1 break.

2024-01-15 [Mikołaj Chyła]: Some delay due to friday's all day training. I'll compare the TAD-X captures with snapshot logs today.
2024-01-12 [Mikołaj Chyła]: Next step is to compare the TAD-X captures with snapshot logs from the same IR reproduction.
2024-01-11 [Mikołaj Chyła]: I&V team to provide some description & additional information about the files captured with TAD-X. IR331158  send, no LE yet. 
2024-01-10 [Mikołaj Chyła]: In TAD-X_captures folder of the logs package we have 14 files. Stilll checking which of those are captures of the system module transmission, and which are captures of the radio transmission.
2024-01-09 [Mikołaj Chyła]: Belows AP from yesterday is under checking, no breakthrough yet.   
2024-01-08 [Mikołaj Chyła]: After consultations with TAD-X & MenuK expert Jarek Blaszkiewicz we decided that MenuK is not the suitable tool for the analysis that is needed from MCU HWAPI BBB perspective. However a different tool was proposed for this task. Next step is is to check the existing tad-x captures with it's help, and perhaps discuss with the testing team the capture procedure in details.

2023-12-22 [MCUHWAPI] Mikolaj Chyla: PR has been already reassigned. I need to get to know in details with topic.  
2023-12-21 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: All facts show that the problem is in the signal sent by the FZHN, but radio does not accept the transfer.
2023-12-20/19 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: IR analysis added. TAD-X is synchronized to the signal sent by BBMOD, so we can be sure that the signal from FBIH is valid and the FZHN should synchronize to the same signal. Pending FZHN analysis. LE: 20.12
2023-12-18 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Last IR with TAD-X captures seems to be fine, DL data captured with both protocol versions 2 and 1. Checking continues.

2023-12-14 Dominik Kawala: Getting in touch with RF team managing TAD-X in order to start working on IR327928. Once we get in touch with TAD-X team and corelate actions, we'll try to provide feasible timeframe.
2023-12-13 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Waiting for IR, no LE yet (one occurrence issue)
2023-12-12 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Tad-x capture was taken about 10 minutes after the issue occured. New logs are needed exactly from the first Cpri sync phase before FID 1868 activated. 
2023-12-11 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Tad-x capture files opened/decoded, analysis ongoing.  Next step: Author to clarify in what time are these files captured/ which direction UL/DL captured. 
2023-12-08 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Still problem to decode Tad-x files, IQP version error.
2023-12-07 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Can't decode Tad-x dat files due to missing admin rights. Help asked from Wroclaw team.
2023-12-07 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: TAD-X log checking ongoing.

2023-11-20 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Logging improvement discussion continues with LFS BBB / Heikki Autio.
2023-11-17/16 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: So far no any logging improvement idea found, but one more question for radio: RFSW to clarify if they are all crxCkFifoLvl changes printed on radio side or only with link configuration.
2023-11-15 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Discussion with specification, Heikki Autio's idea to centralize RX fifo does not make sense. Logging improvements discussion continues.
2023-11-14 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Conclusion after all investigations, Link from FSIH-14 to radio Cpri1 configured the first, but signal is unstable both side, radio did not get HFNSYNC and LFS BBB can't get HFNSYNC because rx_fifo_lvl is fluctuating. Logging improvement discussion continues with specification.
2023-11-14 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: RFSW needed to check further why radio did not  use Cpri1 as clock source after link configured and signal is present.
2023-11-13 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Discussion with specification ongoing.
2023-11-10 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: MCUHWAPI analysis updated after discussion with LFS BBB. No any logging improvements idea, but Heikki Autio had one idea to set RX fifo to center if no HFNSYNC on 45 seconds , but we need a discussion with specification guys, can we do this.  
2023-11-10 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: I will discuss with LFS BBB guys, is it possible to create logging improvement here to avoid such situation in the future.
2023-09-11 Dominik Kawala: 
As we have no access to necessary equipment we have no other option but to cancel the IR. In order to move forward with such request we would need support from a BB team and if you could arrange that, we would gladly help.
2023-11-09 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: IR sent to reproduce with Cpri analyser to be sure is the issue on FBIH LFS BBB side or on FZHN side.
2023-11-09 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: RFSW to clarify what happened at FZHN side, when protocol version changed to 1 on HWAPI side.
2023-11-08 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: More detailed analysis added. Discussion with RFSW continues on GC. 
2023-11-08 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: rx_fifo_lvl fluctuation ends after radio starts transmitter again. Investigation continues with this focus.
2023-11-07 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Clock source has set ok on early startup. Also radio clock seems stable after the first link sync.  
2023-11-07 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Clock source for all FBIH cards (also FSP12 and FCT) is common (CCSSHA FPGA). They do not have control over individual back plane lines trough which clock goes to FBIH3 MURKKU2. Inv will be continued today.
2023-11-06 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: MCU HWAPI C&S to check is there clock issue on FBIH SN:L1144220848 before 19:50:17
2023-11-06 [RFSW] zheng ping: radio start transmission correctly,  HWAPI misunderstand the timetamp.
2023-11-03 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: MCUHWAPI_Analysis_6 added. Radio did not start transmitter during the first synchronization with FujitsuIr.
2023-11-03 [MCUHWAPI] Ossi Haapakoski: Inv started.
2023-11-02: [Krzysztof Gomulec] MCU HWAPI BBB to check why the signal is not stable from remote.

01-09-2024 Sheena: We checked LTE20 and NR20 on the PA DPD bench and the performance is same as what we are seeing at unit level. Next step, Tian to work with Rich and look into the issue. Alan to check the PA same as what factory is testing.
01-08-2024 Sheena: Rich has tested with both newer and older SW and we are seeing significant difference in performance between LTE5 and NR5. Next step, need to check PA on DPD bench. Also, need someone from DPD team to take a look at the performance impact between LTE and NR.
01-04-2024 Sheena: We have tested the latest HW that we received, and we are still seeing the failures on ACLR/OBUE. We are working on investigating the issue. Next step, we are checking the performance difference between the two RFSW's 100322 SW at 7.4 dB par, and the newer SW at same PAR. We are seeing improvement in performance with older SW but that does not support NR35. Also, we are checking the delta going from NR20 to NR35/40.
1-2-2024:  Units received and Rich has begun checkout.
12-18-2023 Sheena: The AHFII units that are shipped from Jabil MX are still stuck in the customs. Will do pre-check on R&D bench once we receive the units and deliver the unit to Mitch in TA for testing.
12-12-2023 Sheena: The units got shipped from Jabil on Friday (12/08) but we are not seeing any updates on this shipment due to DHL strike. R&D will test the units once we receive them from Jabil.
12-08-2023 Sheena: The HW is being shipped from Jabil today. Once we get the HW R&D is going to do the precheck and provide the unit to TA for testing.
12-05-2023 Sheena: We are continuing to evaluate and find our existing HW that works by pre-checking. The newer units are being shipped from Jabil on Wednesday. 
11-29-2023 Sheena: We are working on continuing to evaluate the current HW while we wait on getting the newer HW coming from the factory that is expected to ship on Monday. 
10-23-2023 DMueller:  investigation by tian points to a change in clipper PAR, which is causing this feature and the formerly passing 40Mhz carrier to fail.  Transferring pronto to the HW team for resolution.
10-20-2023:  MuellerD downgraded criticallity to C-class.  ""TOP"" status is up to program/project manager to obtain.  Tian He working the issue, and  looks like the best we can do is create a unique use case in DPD json file to handle the standalone carrier at the band edge to use hybrid instead of single-band mode.  Initial testing in the lab looks like the unit barely gets under the -19dBm level requirement.  Not clear how the clipper PAR got changed to 8.2dB...when it was certified with 7.4dB PAR...but that's left up to the HW project manager.
10-18-2023:Mitch Hill: Dallas DPD is already investigating this issue. 
10-19-2023: Tian He: The root cause of the failure is the PAR increase from 7.4dB to 8.2dB going from old SW to new. There may or may not be much DPD can do to make this pass. But we’ll give it an honest try. I see that due to the ordering of the usecases, this test case actually uses single band engine rather than hybrid. So, @Mitchell Hill (Nokia), start with dpdmr_dlpath_usecaseSwap.json that fixes this. And then try the other file as well where I’ve enabled sounding. Both work with 24r1.

10-19-2023: Tian He: Results came back. The dpdmr_dlpath_usecaseSwap.json performs the best, which is using the non-sounding version of the hybrid usecase for 1xNR40. And I’m afraid that’s all DPD team can do. The sounding version didn’t behave as well.","unknown","SBTS00 No LE Set, SBTS24R1 No LE Set","[object Object], [object Object]","0","0","0",5,,89,"Investigating","SBTS00","3 - Normal","Permanent","C - Minor",,"CR1446511 | SBTS00 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS00_ENB_9999_xxx_yyy | Correcting | , CR1457727 | SBTS24R1 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS24R1_ENB_0000_xxx_yyy | Correcting | ",,"Mitchell Hill (Nokia)","RF_VERIFICATION_PRODVRF_TA_DA2","Aldo Torres (Nokia)","RPZODIAHFII","Mike Pieper (Nokia)","MN RF Product Dev US","Timothy Lee (Nokia)","Bob Delorenzo (Nokia)","MN RF Product Development","Olli Raikaa (Nokia)","MN RF","Ossi Timonen (Nokia)","Sheena Hussaini (Nokia)","Mike Pieper (Nokia)","CR1446511   RF_DTX_DPD, CR1457727   RPZODIAHFII","RF HW","5G Radio","5G Radio","System_Operability","2023-10-18T16:59:53",,89,"[2023-10-19 02:45 - pronto rep_portal 50612658]: [Automation][Not a blocker] New FOT feature testing

[#TF LEADER: Paweł Jastrzębski]
2023-01-15 yangb [RFSW] IR33142 shows problem was not reproduced with N type configuration, as UL tput was only tested on RMOD-3 while enhanced configuration maps cells on both RMOD-2 and RMOD-3, so we still expected tester to check UL tput on RMOD-2 to solid above conclusion. After that we can confirm the problem is only related to enhanced configuration (RF split for RFSW).     
2023-01-12 yangb [RFSW] last IR also proves issue is not related to cell setup order, and cell 296 has still been always failed now. Last 2 IRs point that issue should not be related to RU timing.  
2023-01-11 yangb [RFSW]issue has been proved not related to primary link, new IR sent to find whether cell order affects. checking logs.  
2023-01-10 yangb [RFSW] IR330831 sent to identify whether problem is related to primary link selection and cell setup sequence. IR has been responsed and lod is under checking.  
2023-01-09 yangb [RFSW]  
1. concluding timing logs from the passed and failed logs in CB10611, currently the most obvious difference is passed logs have LTE setup firstly. - yangb
2. problem can still be reproduced in CB010564 with SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_240106_000009, will check log. - yangb

2023-01-08 yangb [RFSW] 
1. CB10611 case passed with RFSW revert knife, checking logs
2. Also CB10611 passed with newest BTS load SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_240106_000009, tester will check whether this load can pass in CB010564 case also. RFSW will check the changes between SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_240104_000002 and  SBTS24R2_ENB_9999_240106_000009.

2023-01-05 yangb [RFSW] 
1. Denisa Grigore (Nokia) to run CB10611 case with B8, if Tput problem can be reproduced please collect RU IQ. Yang Bu will check whether same case can be reproduced in CB10611.
----- problem can be reproduced and log is under checking. LE today.
2.  Ping 1. Li (NSB) to check why UE sent with mcs27 
----- done, mcs27 is used for retransmission. L2PS set this DCI field with 28+rv when retransmission.


2023-01-04 yangb [RFSW] problem may be a UE issue and plan to use spectrum analyzer to measure the UE signal. Tester will back from holiday today and we will have detail discussion about the SA measurement in today's TF meeting.   
2023-12-25 yangb [RFSW] planed to check RF signal with spectrum analyzer after  January 3rd (test team come back from holiday). Meanwhile RFSW will try to fond clues from existing logs.
2023-12-22 rrechesa [ST_RFS] From today until January 3rd (including) Denisa Grigore will be OoO. We will not provide support during this period considering that it is the period with the winter holidays.(Christmas and New Year) In case there will be requests for us, we will take care of them from January 4th. This approach was agreed together with CB010564 FOT leader. Thank you for understanding!
2023-12-22 yangb [RFSW] As no more clues can be found in RU log and IQ data and we cannot determine whether UE really send data on slot 15, we are now Discussing with RF colleagues how we can get RF power and whether we can use spectrum analyzer to get the RF signal.
2023-12-21 yangb [RFSW] UE log shows some abnormal points in MSC value, will continue check in TF meeting. RFSW will also compare logs from last 2 IRs to find some possible clues. 
2023-12-20 yangb [RFSW] RFSW has analysised more IQ and still incline to think it's a UE issue, as in most frames slot 5/15 are empty while RFSW cannot drop certain slots only on one cell in multi-cell case as switching point is configured per antenna rather than per carrier. UE checking is ongoing.
2023-12-19 yangb [RFSW] new IQ captured for L1 and RFSW to check. Currently problem still tend to be a UE issue, we are also waiting analysis from UE log. 
2023-12-18 yangb [RFSW] L1 has same finding as RFSW that the RX power was not stable and some slots were empty. As PCI296 was normal in the same time and RFSW handle timing per antenna, so we think it would be a UE issue and need checking in UE logs
2023-12-15 yangb [RFSW] in last IR we get RX power measurement from RU and found abnormal on RMOD-3 ANT1, the power on ANT1 was too high and not balanced with power of RMOD-2. Usually it may be a environment or UE issue. While we didn't get RU IQ capture as required which is needed to further investigation. will check with tester today. L1 UL checking is also on going.
2023-12-14 yangb [RFSW] L1UL found the UL power was small when problem reproduced. we've sent IR to get RU RX power and L1 IQ data.
2023-12-13 yangb [RFSW] TTI trace has been analysis by L2 and finding problem in poor deltaSinr. From RFSW we can read RX power by manual command to check whether any problem in UL signal receiving, will discuss in today's TF meeting.   
2023-12-12 yangb [RFSW] TF is finding L2-PS expert to check TTI trace 
2023-12-11 yangb [RFSW] checking timing configuration from last IR log, will share result in today's TF meeting. 
2023-12-08 yangb [RFSW] TF continue with same slot as PR731456, RFSW delivered a debug knife and will check the snapshot, meanwhile TTI trace was collected and waiting analysis in today's TF meeting. 
2023-12-07 yangb [RFSW] DL and UL are actually different issues, DL issue has been fixed in PR731456, now we detached this PR from PR731456 to continue investigating UL issue. 

SBTS24R1 Correction form created base build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007)
2023-11-22 Discussing whether this case can be attached to PR731456, since same failure pattern and trigger method seen in both cases. Investigating on PR731456 is now focused on RU timing and BBU synchronization issue.
2023-11-21 yangb [RFSW] case is similar as PR731456, current suspicion points are on RF timing and BBU sync issue, investigating on going.
2023-11-20 yangb [RFSW] last IR is not executable: cell cannot be on air with only one radio up (maybe limited by the implementation of the feature cb010564). We are thinking about new method to check.
2023-11-17 yangb [RFSW] since in this case, we can see bler on all 4 rank in the affected cell while which is combined by 2 individual radio unit(RMOD2 and RMOD3), and resetting action only done in RMOD3. there's suspicion point that if bles caused by RMOD3 resetting ,while bler also seen in TRx of RMOD2. We will try to simplify the case by remaining only one RU in the cell and see whether problem can be reproduced. preparing detailed testing steps and will sent by IR today 
2023-11-15 [RUMAG]Billow: This AWHHF not support FLRXIBLE_TDD_SWITCHING_CONFIG at present.
2023-11-14 yangb [RFSW] Got RU IQ capturing by IR324410, now analyzing the IQ data.

2023-11-03 Hai Ren [CPCU]: Latest IR result shows failure case is occasional, and SBTS24R1_ENB_9999_231027_000005 is not the pass load. So L1 shall continue checking of BLER.
2023-11-02 Hai Ren [CPCU]: Part of IR log is available now, the log double-confirmed the test can not reach code path of PR735161 fix. 2nd finding is that even with the bad load the BLER is much better than the original result.
2023-11-01 Hai Ren [CPCU]: It is weird that CP change (PR735161 fix) is suspected as this issue fix. IR is raised to check: 1. test result stability 2. OK/NOK log difference in debug-level.

2023-10-23 yangb [RFSW]: issue seems related to primary link selection of RU, still investigating.
2023-10-20 yangb [RFSW]: new issue to RFSW, checking logs
2023-10-19 ChristophN: Calls in Event Trace suffer from air quality becoming worse both in DL and in UL. This makes Rank and Mcs going down. L2-PS does not cause Bler or Dtx. It just reacts on Bler by adapting Rank and Mcs accordingly. As the test has as main step the ""Radio Module Reset"" and recovery, RF team should do initial analysis.

2023-10-20: L2-LO 1. CP-RT investigated this issue. They found new problem. 2. L2LO provided enough logs, no new log needs to add. Next step: CP-RT continue to investigate it. And they want to open debug log to get more prints. 
2023-10-19: L2-LO based on the BTC analysis, the cellid which CP-RT sent to BTC was wrong, missed ""1"". Next step: Need CP-RT experts to investigate why the cellid in TC_NrAppVendorRecordInd is missing that ""1"". Will raise CR.
2023-10-18: L2-LO checked the L2LO log, no issue was found in L2LO. And some error prints in TC_Master. Next step: Will raise CR to request the LOM experts to check whether receive the PCMD data from L2LO and check the error prints.","known","SBTS00 2023-12-29, SBTS23R2 No LE Set, SBTS23R3 No LE Set, SBTS23R4 2023-11-17, SBTS23R4 4.0PD No LE Set, SBTS24R1 No LE Set, SBTS23R4 0.1MP No LE Set","[object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object]","0","0","0",11,,90,"First Correction Complete","SBTS23R2 1.0MP","3 - Normal","Occasional","B - Major","TOP1_23R4-SR_0.1MP","CR1445752 | SBTS00 | LE: 2023-12-29 | SBTS00_ENB_9999_231128_000013 | Correcting | , CR1445753 | SBTS23R2 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS23R2_ENB_0000_xxx_yyy_CNA | Needless | 2023-10-17 11:53:46+02, CR1445754 | SBTS23R3 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS23R3_ENB_0000_xxx_yyy_CNA | Needless | 2023-11-15 08:17:27+01, CR1445755 | SBTS23R4 | LE: 2023-11-17 | SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_000830_000000 | Tested | 2023-11-27 08:01:41+01, CR1450007 | SBTS23R4 4.0PD | LE: No LE Set | SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_000709_yyy_CNA | Needless | 2023-10-30 11:53:59+01, CR1457975 | SBTS24R1 | LE: No LE Set | SBTS24R1_ENB_0000_000110_000000 | Correcting | , CR1458262 | SBTS23R4 0.1MP | LE: No LE Set | SBTS23R4_ENB_0000_000861_yyy_FNE | Needless | 2023-11-27 08:45:50+01","TOP1_23R4-SR_0.1MP","Electra","CUSTOMER",,"ECE_DEV_CHZ_CP_RT","Erin Yan (NSB)","NSB MN RAN L3 SW 1 CN","Minghui Fan (NSB)","Yuanshan Mi (NSB)","MN RAN L3","Kari Skog (Nokia)","MN RAN","Niko Lalu (Nokia)","Jiang Shen (NSB)","Lukasz Golacki (Nokia)","CR1445752 CP-RT Jinbai Cai (NSB) ECE_DEV_CHZ_CP_RT, CR1445753  Iustinian Lupulescu (Nokia) ECE_DEV_CHZ_UP_L2_LO, CR1445754  Ilie Dobren (Nokia) ECE_DEV_CHZ_UP_L2_LO, CR1445755 5G_L3_FLOW_86496 Xiaojin Mou (NSB) L3_EFS_5G_CN1_HZH, CR1445755 CP-RT Jinbai Cai (NSB) ECE_DEV_CHZ_CP_RT, CR1450007  Sebastian Szczepkowicz (Nokia) L3_BTS_TRACE_CTRL_TIM, CR1457975 CP-RT Jinbai Cai (NSB) ECE_DEV_CHZ_CP_RT, CR1458262  Jinbai Cai (NSB) ECE_DEV_CHZ_CP_RT","CP-RT","5G Radio","5G Radio",,"2023-10-17T06:13:27",,90,"",""

2023-11-03 NataliaBiela: [RFSW] CoCo told that pronto was fixed and the problem won't be the same. MCU HWAPI BBB gave they feedback, too. Everything looks fine from they side but needs confirmation. Maybe problem is in received power level on antennas.
2023-11-02 NataliaBiela: [RFSW] Looking further for support in MCU HWAPI BBB and very similar issue was found, it was closed on coco so we are looking also for their feedback.

2023-10-20 AlbertRadaszewski: New PR in UOAM MNT - pending assignment.
2023-10-18 NataliaBiela: [RFSW] BOAM pointed new direction in investigation: it's more like either radio doesn't send the data to cpri or aif2 doens't parse the data in rp3msg or doesnt' detect the rp3msg, so it shall be checked by radio and aif2. Draco is checking the issue and aif2 was just involved into investigation. Therefore LE for analysis this new idea can't be yet given.
2023-10-17 NataliaBiela: [RFSW] Brad Gates helped in analysis and potential RC is: They are not assigning the proper link for ANT2, the GSM cells specifically, and issue is on all 3 units at the sample site snapshot I reviewed. Because of his advice A&S and GSM teams are involved into support. LE for analysis not given.

[#Summary: ]
[#Next steps: ]
2024-01-15 [Cplane]: Took over the case from previous person. Started preparing a knife which should
confirm or deny if cplane's fault, and additionally the knife will crash as soon as hanging resources will
appear. This should narrow down the scope of investigation. 
2024-01-10 [Cplane]: Analysis from lower layers is is ongoing. Nothing new was shared for any AP.
2024-01-10 [Cplane]: Analysis from lower layers is is ongoing. Additional tester was asked for help with problems regarding the log gathering.
2024-01-09 [Cplane]: Still waiting for AP to be done by L2/MAC components.
2024-01-08 [Cplane]: Still waiting for analysis from lower layers.
2024-01-04 [CPlane]: Summary of the investigation so far:
- There are random hanging resources seen in L2/MAC PS in resource_usage files collected by tester,
- Logs are missing for the UEs that are hanging due to high load - IR are designed to help with log collection,
- Latest IR was done with flags that should prioritize L2/MAC PS logs,
- CPlane was assigned to this case becuse we did a debug knife to show that we work correct - at no point there was any evidence for CPlane fault,
- As the missing resources are hanging on the lower layers therefore they should be involved in investigation on this PR and should be responsible for driving this case further

AP: L2 should check the newest set of logs. If they miss the logs for the UEs that are hanging, they should work with the tester and find a way to improve logging.


2024-01-03 [CPlane]: Logs from IR are under investigation. There are hanging resources in MAC PS. Waiting for the analysis from the lower layers.
2024-01-02 - CPlane: investigation ongoing
2023-12-29[PET]Jary Kokkonen:IR32977 runs ongoing through the weekend. LE on 2024-01-02.
2023-12-29 [CPLANE] Kacper Czajkowski: Investigation ongoing. Noticed potential race condition scenario. L2 gives response to a request after almost an hour, which is a very long time. 
2023-12-22 [PET] Jary Kokkonen. LE for IR329277 is 2023-12-29., log runs ongoing.
2023-12-28 [CPLANE] Kacper Czajkowski: Investigation ongoing.
2023-12-27 [CPLANE] Kacper Czajkowski: Investigation ongoing.
2023-12-22 [PET] Jary Kokkonen. LE for IR329277 is 2023-12-28  due to bank holidays.
2023-12-21 [CPLANE] Kacper Czajkowski: Investigation ongoing. SHB and snapshot analysis.
2023-12-20 [CPLANE] Kacper Czajkowski: Investigation ongoing. Further questions to the tester, analyzing SHB logs from IR327616.
2023-12-19 [CPLANE] Jakub Pataluch: Investigation ongoing - need clarification from testing team
SBTS24R1 Correction form created base build (SBTS00_ENB_9999_231122_000007)
2023-12-15 [CPLANE] Karol Kępka: probably lastone retest didn't reproduce problem. We need check when exactly information about resources is collected. There is also the log improvement needed because the logs form L2 and MAC are not visible for the suspiciouse ue   
2023-12-11 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: LE for  IR327616 is on 2023-12-13 since it has been ran for 25 times during the weekend and only once had hanging UEs, sadly eNB2 had BTSLOG2 error and no syslogs collected from that run. For monday will run 2 runs without the knife and flags to verify hanging ues with new shoerter 1h run style. Then on tuesday will ran more runs with little more flags on swconfig to see what causes the hanging ues to disappear. Night have to run CRTs.
2023-12-08 [cplane] Karol Kepka: waiting for reproduction
2023-12-07 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: LE for IR IR326564 is on 2023-12-08 since runs take a lot of time, and testlines busy also with CRFT,, customers cases etc.
2023-12-06 [cplane] Karol Kepka: waiting for reproduction
2023-12-05 [cplane] Karol Kepka: waiting for reproduction
2023-12-04 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: IR326564 runs still ongoing, after multiple multiple runs with desired snapshot trigger, swconfig fiels and EMIL traces ongoing,s till no hanging UEs with original  BTS SW. LE 2023-12-05 and done, if no hanging UES. Normally 5/7 runs have provided hanging UEs with this scenario and SW.
2023-12-01 TF is ongoing. Ideas to solve problem with missing logs is to start collecting logs based on ""straing patterns"" and to incease size of buffer. Test are planned during a weekend, OT is secured. Those test should give us better picture of what is happening in L2
2023-11-30 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: Le for IR326564 at 1.12 due to other tests running on testline.
2023-11-29[PET] Jary Kokkonen: Le for IR326564 at 30.11 due to other tests running on testline.
2023-11-28 Working on knife with very limited logs which allow to analyse communication between macps and l2
2023-11-27 [Cplane] Karol Kępka: the log was checked. communication beatween Cplane nad L2 works correctly. L2 should answer if Mac was informed of te mac_user_delete_req
2023-11-23 [PET] Jary Kokkonen:  IR325713  knife after 1st run, no hangign UEs. Since it requires to use EMIL also,, contiunuing IR on friday.
LE on 24-11 currently.
 2023-11-22 Analyzing ongoing with CPLANE, L2 and MAC_PS. No RC yet
2023-11-20 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: This issue was seen with LATEST TRUNK SW on same configuration TL with ASIL+ABIO+ABIN HW. Also the IR325083  Still after 11 runs, no hanging UEs seen with knife build.. Trying to run original SW again until Tuesday, LE on knife run  21/11/2023 with logs or no logs if the knife wont give hanging UEs...
2023-11-16 [CPlane] Pronto transferred to L3 SW 2 WRO team, investigation started. More information will be provided as soon as the team has some findings
2023-11-15 [CPlane] AUrbanowicz: Found that 1 indicated UE has correctly released resources by sending MAC_UserDeleteReq. Investigation on next indicated UEs ongoing.
2023-11-14 [CPlane] AUrbanowicz: Logs provided, analysis started
2023-11-10 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: Le for  IR324223 is on next monday due to PR734412 testing ongoing.
2023-11-09 [CPlane] AUrbanowicz: IR raised
2023-11-09 [CPlane] AUrbanowicz: changes for debug knife are ready. Building knife is ongoing
2023-11-07 [CPlane] AUrbanowicz: started working on preparing changes for debug knife. Debug knife will add logging to show why UEC didn't send MAC_UserDeleteReq. LE for Knife: 09.11
2023-11-06 Latest logs shows hanging UE on TDD cell only this time. Involved TDDPS experts into investigation and awaiting for initial analysis from L2 and CPLN regarding this hanging UE.
2023-11-03 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: IR323105 ran 4 times, got hanging UEs but Syslogs BTSLOG2 had stopped working. Need to rerun again since no syslogs..
2023-11-03 Awaiting for the IR response.
2023-11-02 [PET] Jary Kokkonen: IR323105  ran already 3 times the site reset ran with knife, still no hanging UEs.. 4th run ongoing.
2023-11-02 IR raised for debug knife testing, limit the log level to WRN/ERR/VIP only and provide knife with prints from L3/L2/MACPS with VIP only for UeDelete.
2023-11-01 Bank holiday in Poland - no MACPS support available.
2023-10-31 Another knife will be provided including L2/L3 and with limited logs to WRN/ERR/VIP only 
2023-10-30 One more idea to involve CPLN into investigation to check whether they see the UE delete trigger to at least spot the proper timestamp where this message can be expected. Logs analysis ongoing with CPLN.
2023-10-27 (?ÃÂ°?ÃÂ°)?? ???
2023-10-26 Analysis provided, need L2 to comment further.
2023-10-25 Some problem occurs with logs gathering but finally we have the logs and investigation is started. Initial analysis will be dropped today and further steps will be defined. 
2023-10-24 Investigation continue with new logs delivered. No info on teams chat about IR response so missed that information early yesterday
2023-10-20 Compering  KPI for both NOK and OK run. NO clear issue find so far 
2023-10-19: Investigation continues, no breakthrough yet
2023-10-18 Logs delivered, investigation ongoing.
2023-10-17 [PET]Jary Kokkonen: Still having hard times reproducing the issue even with original SW on PR. Which gave hanging UEs over 5 times tested before. Dont know if these flags on swconfig or something is affecting this. Continuing trying to reproduce this.
2023-10-17 IR pending awaiting for logs collection. 
2023-10-16 [PET]Jary Kokkonen: Tried once running the original SW with all the logs on. No hanging UEs during that run. Still this has been verified to ahve these on multiple runs before.
Rerunning on 2023-10-17
2023-10-16 Reference logs delivered, to be verified with latest trunk and to collect minimum amount of logs to avoid potential drops in messages/syslog. IR raised
2023-10-13 IR pending
2023-10-12 SBTS00_ENB_9999_231010_000019 initially didn't found hanging UEs, need to confirm whether this can be confirmed or just an occasionally of the issue.
2023-10-11 [PET]Jary Kokkonen: Lab issues, logging PC not connecting to files folder. Will move the IR to next day at least.
2023-10-11 Investigation is ongoing, another expert involved parallel to help in investigation.
2023-10-10 Investigation still ongoing, no breakthrough yet.
2023-10-09 Pronto back from L2 with analysis, to be continued in MACPS.
2023-10-04 Investigation ongoing, analysis shall be ready today.
2023-10-03 Logs received, investigation continued
2023-10-02 IR pending
2023-09-29 Due to maintenance break the LE for the possible IR reponse is next week. Cannot precisely estimate. 
2023-09-28 Found potential problem with missing UeDelete, further investigation is ongoing to confirm whether this is a gap in syslog or real problem.
2023-09-27: Found hanging contexts CRNTI, checking further if logs covering lifecycle of those UEs to find potential reason for not cleaning it out.
2023-09-26: Reassignment done due to load balance.

2024-01-15 Topi Rantalainen: Assemble ticket #5519 opened to Marvell. Baha plans to skip the reset for network pool allocator meanwhile.
2024-01-12 Topi Rantalainen: Logs show some interrupts with unknown pci functions in startup and teardown which are not logged in the pci function mapping. This is really weird. Question is opened to Marvell about this.
2024-01-11 Topi Rantalainen: Baha is having 3rd debug knife logs under analysis. Logs are huge and take some time to analyze. Additionally Baha is creating a fix for one identified problem for further tests.
2024-01-10 Topi Rantalainen: New debug logs added into knife. PCI function reset order is also under investigation. Baha found a missing SSO PCI function dependency in driver related to teardown. Knife investigation continues.
2024-01-09 Topi Rantalainen: First knife was tested and result analysed yesterday and second knife is now under developement.
2024-01-08 Topi Rantalainen: With rovfs/rovfs_cat services disabled still issue seen. New logs \\eseefsn50.emea.nsn-net.net\rotta4internal\RAN_TRUNK\jukkantt\PR729766_IR330460
This confirms there is still an issue in RVU driver HW resources teardown. Baha is now developing a script to dump RVU registers to verify the mapping. This will be tested today.
2024-01-05 Topi Rantalainen: IR responded, still issue seen, logs \\eseefsn50.emea.nsn-net.net\rotta4internal\RAN_TRUNK\jukkantt\PR729766_IR330372 
Baha checked logs, and there is crash, but there is no RVU crash, but it comes from read only virtual file system daemon. 
Baha will prepare a new knife and disable read only virtual file system daemon.
2024-01-04 E.Toivanen: IR Knife testing started.

2023-12-06 L1_SW_PLATFORM: IR with debug knife sent, LE for IR: 07.12 (due to public holiday in Finland). 
2023-12-05 Topi Rantalainen: Baha attempted to reproduce new issue locally, but reproduction was not successfull. Mirka can reproduce it. Next step is to create a debug knife for SBTS00_ENB_9999_231130_000007.
Debug knife is now ready: https://wft.int.net.nokia.com/knife_requests/1091322?project_filters=ALL

2023-11-27 Topi Rantalainen: Baha will submit L1SW changes today for review.
2023-11-27 Jesse Nieminen: 1st part of the fix is done and available in l1sw, the second part is being worked on now.
2023-11-25 Topi Rantalainen: The fix involves two parts; 1) A new IOCTL netdev interface to register the PSM queue to be released upon application crash/exit. netdev will then disable, flush and reset the registered PSM queues when the application crash/exit. 2) The l1sw needs to be modified to use the new IOCTL interface to register the PSM queues used by the application.
The 1st part is done in meta-nokia-octeontx. Baha will provide the 2nd part when the new platform gets integrated to l1sw.

2023-11-21 V.Hurme: Now there are promising results from testing the latest changes as a correction. Due to the fact that latest testing is done in developer's own test bench, latest change must be implemented in a sbts knife for real environment. 
2023-11-21 M.Kyllönen: PR729766 is now occasional
2023-11-20 M.Kyllönen: PR729766 is not seen anymore for a long time.
2023-11-20 Topi Rantalainen: Checking results with new debug knife (by Baha).
2023-11-17 V.Hurme: Testing still continues with a new debug knife and local reproduction.
2023-11-16 B.Mesleh: Corruption is still seen after disabling submitting work to the SSO admission queue. Interrupts regarding un-mapped pcifunction still visible after the teardown for SSO is done, need to investigate the source of those next.
2023-11-13 V.Hurme: A new knife coming to dump SSO data. Assemble ticket #5124 updated with latest findings.
2023-11-10 V.Hurme: Question to Marvell: bphy is using SSO and one queue is increasing in certain situation, when it is not expected. Marvell ticket updated with latest reproduction data.
2023-11-08 V.Hurme: A new issue found from ODP about memory allocations in different situations. A knife will be implemented based on this new finding. 
2023-11-07 Topi Rantalainen: Baha created yesterday a knife with sso queue dumping before tear down. Queues seem to contain data which is not processed. Seems also interrupts are still received. Baha will update Marvell ticket with latest findings.
2023-11-06 V.Hurme: Memory dumps analyzed from the previous knife test, but no resolution. Concentrating again to rvu driver clean-up function. No help from Marvell so far, because they have not reproduced the issue.
2023-11-03 V.Hurme: Knife with page table check didn't work as expected, new knife to be tested shortly.
2023-11-02 Topi Rantalainen: Backport for page table corruption detection received from Wind River to aid debugging.
2023-11-01 V.Hurme: No patch received from Windriver, yet. Odp 
2023-10-31 V.Hurme: Windriver has provided some support for this investigation to backport page table corruption detection.
2023-10-30 Topi Rantalainen: Baha has an idea to use a newer kernel feature to debug Marvell driver. We requested now WR to backport page table corruption detection https://docs.kernel.org/mm/page_table_check.html to LTS21.
2023-10-27 Topi Rantalainen: Baha continues to study the issue.
2023-10-26 Topi Rantalainen: Marvell requested reproducible ODP application (not easy). Baha is now investigating the code and studying HRM to understand how to add useful debug information.
2023-10-24 V.Hurme: Studying of Marvell's feedback continues.
2023-10-23 V.Hurme: Got Marvell's feedback and it's referring to another ticket issue. That will be studied more in L1 platform, suspected not beibg the same issue as in this PR.
2023-10-20 Radek Papke / Loki sync: Waiting Marvell feedback. Investigation will be resumed on Monday when subject matter expert is back from leave. 
2023-10-19 B.Mesleh: NPA reinit fix during FLR didn't work. Marvell ticket open. The ticket number is 5298
2023-10-17 V.Hurme: Debugging has continued. Assembla ticket to be opened to Marvell now.
2023-10-16 V.Hurme: Debug work and knife experiments continue with functional level reset and RVU. Maybe a ticket will be opened to Marvell.
2023-10-13 V.Hurme: Experiment with rvu_driver changes didn't fully work, but reproduction rate was lower. New ideas to be squeezed out.
2023-10-12 V.Hurme: Knife with rfoe change didn't work. New idea incubating for next knife trial.
2023-10-10 V.Hurme: Testing continues in local env. When debugging changes were added, reproduction rate worsened remarkably. One assumption about the root cause to try to implement correction knife, LE for knife: today.
2023-10-06 Topi Rantalainen: Investigation continues with local L1 env.
2023-10-05 MaciejS: Analysis of logs and debugging is still ongoing in L1 env, no LE yet for ending this action.
2023-10-04 V.Hurme: Further debugging is ongoing in local L1 test env. Still strong assumption that the attched prontos have the same issue, even if the outcome may be different.
2023-10-03 MaciejS: Problem visible as task in L1 Platform stuck, writeback flag is set unexpectedly. Local reproduction in L1 env succeed so IR response is no longer critical for investigation.

What has been done since last update; What the planned next steps are; What are LE's for next steps
2024-01-11 KlaudiaKowalenko: [RFSW] Work on SoC SW merge is ongoing
2024-01-15, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Pronto was transferred to OS&Boot for SoC SW WA merge. After WA is merged pronto can be transferred back to SoC A&S as agreed. Mean while SoC A&S continues to find RC with the third party. Next meeting with the third party on 2024-01-16.
2024-01-12, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Track 1 (WA): Waiting SoC SW WA (LE today) after which OS&Boot will continue. Track 2 (finding RC): SoC experts are defining to the third party all the missing information/documentation what is needed to find root cause. Escalated to the third party. Meeting with the third party ASAP. 
2024-01-10, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Agreed today to proceed with improvement which provide 0.1% fail rate. This is the best for now what can be provided without knowing the root cause. SoC SW colleagues are preparing improvement to OS&Boot who owns the uboot. Build is urgent due to the program deadlines. SoC SW is also studying possibility to do re-training improvement but its not yet sure how long that improvement takes. SoC A&S continues to find the root cause.  Lack of detailed documentation regarding the DDR training escalated to the third party today. RF PD continues to support by running tests.           
2024-01-08, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Expected results in weekend tests (not all test lines were able to run tests) providing 0.1% fault rate. SoC SW will do uboot improvements this week and after that integration work continues in OS&Boot. Improvements are not considered as fix and prontos stay open regardless of improvements. Finding root cause continues but it takes probably weeks.  
2024-01-05, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: PR729289 radio unit is in Oulu and tests are running during the weekend. If  the results are promising it is possible to provide intermediate fix decreasing fault rate (not final fix). Root cause is not known.  
2024-01-04, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Two knife images to be tested in pronto-units(with pronto IR), customer units and second-source units(for reference).
All these boards should be ran for minimum 2000 boot loops with both F- and F2-knife images, with F-image as the priority.
F2-image needs measurements to clarify if it can be used or not due to concerns about non-compliant operation, as it disables duty-cycle correction(DCC) training . LE: Next week, not fitting to 2.0 timeline.
2024-01-03, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: As for a short term plan, a testing knife will be provided soon for each attached prontos. The knife will not be a final solution but significantly decreases the fail rate. In the background there are several trials ongoing to find out the root cause and a final fix. Based on the current understanding the reason for fails points to strobe duty cycle correction and its possible relation to drive and termination resistance and dynamic range overflows.   
2024-01-02, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Due to the fact we do not know root cause yet, we need to discuss and make a decision if we should release parameters which improve the fail rate to 0.1 percent. It will not be a final fix. Meanwhile, finding root cause continues. Experts are analyzing which parameter changes provide the best output if parameter changes are decided to do.    
2023-12-29 SPu: 1-2 more tests with modified SoC SW uboot-images. ( ""f2""  mentioned above)
Then further tests could be done with actual product SW(could be done with ""unofficial"" product SW) for understanding if the other related PRs show similar improvement and do not show other problems arising.
Thirdly a signal integrity simulation (can be done in parallel).
and finally make the improvements to SoC SW and then to RFSW.
Still, I dont think we have the root cause, but if the fail rate is improved significantly it offers more time for trying to identify the root cause.
2023-12-28 SPu: S11-board experiments with the a-c images:
a2 and f2 images with duty-cycle correction removed from ""baseline"" and ""most stable"".
With a2-image(1.4% fails), the results are significantly better than with a(3.5%).
There is no results from f2 yet.
The problem with this proposal is that according to measurements  made for MARS ES2 showed that without duty-cycle correction, the related timing parameter (strobe duty cycle tDQSH & tDQSL) will fail the JEDEC compliance measurement, but first we need to see how that ""f2"" image will behave, then evaluate how the duty-cycle timing could be corrected.
2023/12/22, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Five tests executed. Results do not reveal root cause yet. For some reason duty cycle calibration fails and it is seen as over- and underflow values. Investigation leader has asked explanation from Cadence. Next step is to disable duty cycle correction and see if the duty cycle overflow causes the training defect. Work is ongoing.     
2023/12/20, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: There are five test cases (a-e). Each test case runs 2000 loops. A and b test are now run. It still takes two days to finalize the rest of the test cases. Then experts see which mitigation proposals have most effect. In best case results provide also some hints to root cause.      
2023/12/19, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Mitigations suggestions are separated to different debug test cases. Each tests are run at least 2000 loops. After test runs mitigation suggestion effects will be evaluated separately.  
2023/12/15, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Currently fail rate improving suggestions available. However, root cause is not yet known and only defect mitigation solution is available. Mitigation is not considered as possible delivery. Current understanding is something is missed in the DDR training and next step is to perform sensitivity tests which suggestions are the most effective and leads to root cause.      
2023/12/14, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: RF prepared three different test knife packet including fix proposals suggested by SoC AS. Tests ongoing.
2023/12/12, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: Root cause not found yet. Improvement seen, now 3/2688 initializations fails instead of original 10%. Root cause isolation ongoing.
2023/12/08, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: RF test model will be tested next. Training parameter changes has reduced the issue to 1/10th but it still exists. Current hypothesis is that training is missing some SW phases. Proof for this hypothesis is studied.   
2023/12/07, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: PR729289, PR733900 and PR737445 attached. Mars component changed. Over night  boot looping ongoing to see if issue preproduced.   
2023-12-05, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: The third party IO architect proposed to change command/address bus DDR4 to DDR3. No technical justification given. Nokia team will test if this improves anything.     
2023-12-01, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]: One memory component was replaced, after which one of the training values (RDDQS GATE) was improved. Even the value was improved, the board still fails about 10% of the time during DDR init, next step will be to remove MARS and reattach it to another location on the same board to see if the problem follows MARS.
2023-11-28, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]:
Experts are able to see from symptons and logs where the fail happens. Training sequences are done mainly on HW and debugging is slow. No breakthrough yet. 
2023-11-24, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]:
Investigation and trials still ongoing. Waiting for analysis results and proposal for fix. LE for analysis is not yet clear. 
2023-11-17, Janne Janhunen [SoC AS]:
Experiments to find correction ongoing. Some experiments did not work. Trialing with different IO-parameters(termination and drive-strength). The new settings seemed to work well in that board(eye-diagram is more open) and simulations will continue.

2023-10-24:TerryLiao:waitting for IR
2023-10-19 George: Awaiting updates here on progress of investigation.
2023-10-17 Ppadhy: L2 knife requested for further investigation.
2023-10-16 Ppadhy: No clue yet, requested L2 team to provide a knife by enabling EMC statistic counters prints.
2023-10-12 Ppadhy: L1 Logs does not have any ESV or other EM errors. Same event pointer is not used (allocated, send or freed) different places. It does not rule out that event pointer is accessed after send. SoCSW, are not doing the EMC on Marlin side. We have done it on Thor side. Fragmentation has been working since day one on our environment (Thor). Meaning that we cannot reproduce the issue and dig any further. 
2023-10-10 HNy: With provided knife, issue reproduced, and logs collected. Investigation is ongoing,

2023-10-09 HNy L1 made a knife and enable event state verification. That could rule out the possibility that event data is corrupted before send. IR created:  To check if L1 has issues with event state validation.

2023-10-04 HNy ""Bart C this is definitely not a job for L2PS, and not for L1 App of course"". And not for SoC SW. Currently this does not look like a BTS SW issue.

2023-10-04 HNy Binhao Qian (NSB) confirmed that L1 is sending proper payload. Suspect that the rest of the payload of corrupted message is lost somewhere between L1 and L2PS. It would correspond with the fact that L2LO fragments are also lost.

2023-10-03 HNy  No evidence that there would be something wrong on SOC_SW_REALTIME. Bernand P prepared new knife to print corrupted message hex payload on L2PS side. That knife is working as planned. Next: compare these messages  with other, correct messages that are visible in wireshark to search for some clues what may be wrong.

 Next test it on same build as before. IR is needed for knife.

2023-09-27: L1_SW_5G_UL_PHY_HZH Qian Binhao:  UL_PHY analysis done. File: ULPHY_Analysis.docx attached. 
Next step:
l1 soc team (SOC_SW_REALTIME ) need to check why the message l1 send to l2 is corrupted during transmission, and to check why there are so many reassemble message due to missing of fragments.

2023-09-26 Qian Binhao: 
- Debug knife tested, new logs provided, is checking and will give analysis today.
- Is asking SOC to check fragment corrupted issue.
2023-09-25 Qian Binhao: 
L2PS find first package of fragment message event is missing. It is suspected message fragment bug cause problem. BIP message size is also incorrect. EM-ODP is involved to check.
Those messages with fragment fault is blocking investigation as we cannot compare BIP log with L2PS print or TTI trace.  
No log print of L1 trigger in last debug knife. Discuss with L2PS on why debug knife doesn't work. 
2023-09-23 Qian Binhao: 
- New debug knife sent for test. More debug information added in both L2PS and L1.
- Platform experts of both Marlin(L2PS) and Thor(L1) are involved to check any specific BIP/message limitation on ABIP since fault is not seen in ABIO
2023-09-22 Qian Binhao:
- The debug knife can't be run in testline, L2 will prepare the knife again based on old build today.
2023-09-21 Qian Binhao:
- After discussed, L2 will provide one new debug knife to print the message context today.
2023-09-20 Qian Binhao:
- Continue discussing with L2 to point if current bip logs have the problematical message.
2023-09-19 Qian Binhao:
- Continue checking the bip logs to find which message is wrong, which to compare with syslog.
2023-09-16 Qian Binhao: 
- New logs proivided which are matched, checking is ongoing and will provide analysis today.
2023-09-15 Qian Binhao: 
- The logs still not matched that bip logs not cover issue, will ask tester to collect again today.

[#Summary: incorrect order of rp3 messages - the reason for this is that order of rp3 messages in AxC#0 is preserved. It is the same for OK and NOK case, so TS.bit0 = 0 and data from ST0 is present before ST1 - this is expected. Data with TS.bit0=1 are written to AxC#1 and the only way (as I see it) to have swap here is when data from ST1 is present before ST0 on DDL_IF interface.]

2024-01-15 MPe: There was another bug in the knife build, which already got fixed. It should be retested internally today.

2024-01-12 MPe: Knife tests pending. 
2024-01-11 MPe Possible soution provided for SoC Robert Dziekonsk prepared a knife and sent it for internal testing.
 

2024-01-10 MPe: 
NEXT:1) SoC HW team did simulation and confirmed that issue is present , spec is updated. They proposed solution for handling issue and part of it is CRC_AXC_CTRL which has not been verified - this is the reason for new knife to test that proposal actually works.
2) SoC SW has to provide missing content for CRX_AXC_CTRL
3) Coco will use updated api (when available) to provide proper implementation - not the PoC as it is now in knife

LE: So we are now at step 2) waiting for SoC SW. LE unknown

2024-01-09 MPe: NEXT:IR pending to test a knife
LE: not avalable
2024-01-08 MPe: From Teams chat Toni Viitanen's statement:"" First of all this is new functionality and having it done as pronto correction is not so simple. We need to make sure there is specs done by architect team who are currently on holidays and make sure all the hw docs are updated and make sure this new functionality does not break anything, then we can start to implement it. So as soon as we have specs we can implement""

2023-12-22 RobertDziekonski: [RFSW] SoC SW colleagues to implement additional method that will provide a functionality to update stream interface basing on provided specific shared::carrierid_t without prior disabling of the carrier.
2023-12-21 RobertDziekonski: [RFSW] Pending question to SoC SW team - Keijo Kjeldsen - to provide new function for reconfiguration of carrier stream interface without disabling carrier, as per logs from last IR every time reconfiguraiton happens using Connip library carrier is being disabled. Even if enable will be called once again the procedure of disable can damage the flow which will results in radio errors.

2023-11-24 MPe: Transferred bask as documentation is not updated yet. SOC_HW_CONNECTIVITY please transfer PR back after updating documentation.
2023-11-21 MPe: When reviewing the simulation results we made one important discovery: original AxC configuration in pronto is incorrect.
UG requires all CRX AxCs of single aggregate to be placed to same interface. But, the different aggregates should be placed in alternating interfaces to balance the load. With this change, the original configuration runs OK without WA.
However, the problem will be visible with NR100 or wider, and there we need to have WA.
2023-11-20 MPe: 96-bit gap works as a general case (so also for other aggregates N50/NR100/NR200/NR400). We will still run some random regressions during weekend and also run verification of WA1 and WA2.
2023-11-17 MPe: Next  testing NR100 and random configurations. Results pending.
2023-11-16 MPe: Simulation infrastructure changes done and are now iterating to get minimum gap needed for WA3. So far we know that 96-bit gap between containers work, 48-bit does not. Some iterations still needed to get the final figure.Other proposals will be verified as well
2023-11-15 MPe: WA1 is beinmg tested.
2023-11-14 MPe:At the moment we have identified three different candidates for WA:
WA1: Use lower CPRI link speed (like 24x).
WA2: Do not use sample compression for AxCs. 
WA3: Leave empty space between individual AxC containers forming the aggregate in CPRI frame.
 
At the moment we believe each one will work, but we will verify that (and scope the needed empty space for WA3).WA1 and WA2 should be straightforward and I hope to get results tomorrow. WA3 is more tedious and I think will take at least till Wednesday.
2023-11-13 MPe: Finally  duplicated the error in simulation environment. The message order from CRX changes and that causes DDL to mix AxC data. The error happens only on some start-ups (depends on frame timing vs. link enable timing). 
Next step is to implement and verify the WA. This will need some bigger changes to verification environment, so I expect it will take 2-3 days.
2023-11-10 MPe: Teams discussion ongoing. No break through yet.
2023-11-09 MPe: Status update: We are still working on reproducing the issue in simulation. Once that is done we can start work on testing the WA. Hard to say any LE yet.
2023-11-08 MPe:Simulations ongoing. no LE. 
2023-11-07 MPe: Simulating the WA properly needs some major changes to the testbench. For that I have asked for support from our verification experts. Can't yet say any estimate when the simulation is ready.
2023-11-06 MPe: WA suggestions:1. build AxC aggregates out of LTE10 (CONTAINER_N=4)
or2. leave empty space between AxCs of different aggregates
2023-11-03 MPe:  Ilmari has  replicated the simple configuration in simulation.

Further steps to be established on TF meeting
2023-09-27 TSZkudlapski [RFSW] HW suggest to use additional fiber in setup - it might help with issue on wider BW where issue occurs. Waiting for draco analysis of latest findings which might be delayed due to training session (looking for some substitute in the meantime)
2023-09-26 TSzkudlapski [RFSW] Abnormal behavior seems to be some HW issue. IR responded - logs analysis ongoing. Very likely another set of logs will be needed from the moment when tput goes from normal to degradate, but after latest would be analyzed. Waiting for HW response, if issue was reproduced on their setup to check for any HW design issue
2023-09-25 TSzkudlapski [RFSW] DPD asked to check abnormal behavior on ANT4. Sufficient logs from MADE2 required. Coco needs to help explain errors from startup in made2. DAPD needs to help with explaining, if there is any dependency for DCO results for I and Q data with blocked cell

2023-08-29 JakubJonak: Further checking of IQ data ongoing, LE: today. RFSW suppport ongoing but no breakthrough on their side, potential wider discussion will be done on todays TF meeting.
2023-08-28 JakubJonak: Another round of IQ data collection requested via IR as the previous one couldn't be properly analyzed due to some error that couldn't be overcome. RFSW support already started work on this case yesterday, Draco team to be involved as RF CTRL shows an error which could potentially be related.
2023-08-27 JakubJonak: IQ data analysis still ongoing, no issue on L1 side found so far. LE for finish: today. Other TF APs will continue on Monday as other DUs support is not available during the weekend.
2023-08-26 JakubJonak: Analysis of data from IR ongoing. L1 approach is to confirm proper DL encoding as it is close to be impossible that the RC lays in L1SW due to this issue behavior - L1 doesn't see any impact on other cells due to blockage of separate cell. This problem potentially lays in RFSW, which representatives were already added to discussion. 

We need RF supporting on Sunday as possibly there is no OT request raised to RF on Friday afternoon when I read the PR chat.

2024-01-03 ksobota: While testing a knife I noticed that debug prints are not sufficient. In particular I see in local testing that transactions are associated with generic names, like 'bash', but for example I'd like to have full view about which particular script is executed by bash. This required a significantly more effort and troubleshooting to get full paths of processes at kernel level. I had to reach out to kernel team for guidance and currently I'm applying their suggestion to my debug knife.
2023-12-22 ksobota: I have knife ready implementation-wise, I just have to port that on top of latest Trunk PS branch, but found no time for it today due to other PRs. Will resume on 27th after Christmas break.
2023-12-22 Petar Barac Work on debug-knife ongoing.Probably until EOB today will be ready(if not too much side work will be needed)
2023-12-19 ksobota: There was lots of side discussion and experimentation. I'm currently working on a debug knife that will capture ALL I2C transactions combined with GPIO states from SW. I intend to make IR end of week. Overall I iterated through many different hypothesis, but what often looks promising on one platform, has no right to work on different platform (and issue happens everywhere). I think there has to be some combination of race condition, reset, potentially a sequence of I2C transactions and a specific state of BMU. So far I only managed to reproduce short lived bus stuck conditions.
2023-12-06/18 M.Hejmanowska: RC unknown. 03374708 set RFT with WA. No identified RC. Discussions ongoing about I2C issues. 
2023-11-28 ksobota: Referring to my update from 2023-11-09. I did a ton of various tests involving intentionally breaking the bus using BMUX image that pulls SDA low and I even injected faulty states into XIIC bus device to force it to act as slave to prove hypothesis that XIIC enters loopback mode, but with no luck currently. There are some clues in PR732644 although not confirmed, I2C problems maybe are correlated with thermal cycles which would explain why almost all reproduction attempts are failing (e.g. when board is moved to other lab it stops reproducing, but when it's brought back to original lab, it reproduces again). I'm currently looking deep into LM75 (temperature sensor) specification and I try to break LM75 locally. The TF with Anssi did not happen yet (although it's expected to happen this week - no invitation yet), it could accelerate investigations.
2023-11-27 Ewa Szukala: code under checking 
2023-11-21 Ewa Szukala: TOP label removed; WA worked, code after WA will be now checked to find real RC
2023-11-21 [author] will provide the result still today.
2023-11-17/ 20: Ewa Szukala: decided to test it with WA and confirm that issue is no longer visible starting from SBTS00_ENB_9999_230726_000017
2023-11-16 [ksobota]: My status is the same as on 09. Those things require complex changes to driver to validate some of my ideas - and this takes time. Nothing more to add.
2023-11~16 Ewa Szukała: above next step valid; this problem is no longer visible on the newest SW; PR will stay open to get RC (visible on this particular TL after reverting WA). 
 
…/i2c_slave_reg_ext.vhd · Gerrit Code Review (nokia.com) in BMUXP 23.25.1 introduced a watchdog on the I²C slave core of the I2C_EXT interface to the System Module, which resets the I²C slave if BMU detects I²C is stuck for more than 1 s. 
Earlier, that WD was only of L1 SoC I²C slave core.
In ABIP_BMUXP_update_23.25.1 - Workflow Tool (nokia.com) it is described as ""- merge I2C slaves cores design on FCT and THOR side.""

2023-11-09/10 [ksobota] I reworked my parser to reconstruct entire communication on I2C backplane based on traces and I generated script that executes 170000+ transactions to follow identical steps performed on TL. I executed it, but it did not reproduce issue although I'll still need find better target and make some sanitation to environment to ensure my sequence doesn't get impacted by other transactions in the background or minor HW differences. In the background I also explore some other suggestions by my team members. On top of that, I've been intensively researching possible triggers for anomalous transactions on 0x00 by building locally ran knives, result so far is that SW is not producing those transactions (at least on my target) as those do not go through i2c-xiic driver. I brainstormed this situation with William Fox as PICASSO uses I2C XIIC cores that we use on backplane, about who possibility could create those transactions if it's not SW. I got some further hints from XIIC spec that this device has a functionality to respond on general call address (0x00). My current hypothesis (although requiring an extreme situation) is that a condition for upstream breaking requires downstream to hung on SDA set low, but SCL toggling. Normally, if SDA is pulled low, without SCL pulse it's interpreted as arbitration lost, but here the situation is bit more strange. SDA is pulled low, but SCL keeps pulsating. There is no START condition, so protocol-wise it's invalid, but yet controller tries to cope with it. However in extreme case, flag in controller is set to enable reaction to general call address. This could be caused by e.g. previously lost arbitration due to hung SCL (and then subsequent recovery, but flag still set) and then controller - influenced by second occurrence of downstream stuck condition (but this time with hung SDA) switches operating mode into IIC slave core, that is then permanently stuck reading endless ""data"" from SDA. However to refine and dis/prove this hypothesis I continue with trace analysis and I'll be conducting numerous experiments next week. (10th of Nov I'm OoO).
2023-11-06/07/08 Ewa Szukala: chcking who could prepare top- down analysis fro FPGA code
2023-11-1 [author] Krzysztof Sobota is on annual leave and back on Nov.6th, Ewa Szukala set this pronto as ON HOLD status.
2023-10-27 [ksobota] I'm still in process of analyzing I2C traces. So far I found few anomalous transactions towards generic call address (0x00) that look like random writes around time of site resets. Any transaction to 0x00 can be received by any slave on the bus and possibly cause malfunction. However such write is not visible around a reset when issue appear, so more investigation required in the area. I also wrote a parser for better representation of collected data and as a next step I wanted to compute clock speed based on duration/start time of I2C traces to confirm we're always running in 100 kHz mode. Separately, I wrote bruteforcing tool that generates similar looking patterns observed in I2C traces and it was running for couple of hours along with hammering BMU with transactions yesterday without a reproduction of a problem. I also triggered a reset of ABIP couple of times, but nothing reproduces (I didn't automated resets yet). This suggests writes to 0x00 might not be a RC, but perhaps those are necessary step/part in sequence that breaks the bus. It would also appear that sequence leading to problem might be depended on some upper layer triggers that normally don't occur in pure LFS env.
2023-10-23 [ksobota] I2C traces analysis in progress, it might take few days to have some conclusions as there is a lot to go through. Reminder that issue is not reproducing starting from SBTS00_ENB_9999_230726_000017, but we're still looking for RC as it could hint at what's wrong in other PR cases with I2C issues.
2023-10-19 [author] I2C SDA Log is captured on latest IR, wait for analysis.
2023-10-17 [author] Capture log and checked by Yu 8. Chen, there is no effective SDA data captured on this knife, so need to generate one new knife by Lionel Tchernatinsky (Nokia) after teams chat confirmed.
2023-10-15 [author] issue reproduced and I2C log collected when connecting to ABIP HE 10 Pin9 and Pin 10.
2023-10-13 [author] after consoling, no SDA data when connecting to PIN8 and PIN 10.
it usually caused by two possible reason,
one possible is console issue, this should be checked next Monday.
another is knife don't make SDA out. Krzysztof Sobota (Nokia) will double check the knife.
update IR LE: 10.17
2023-10-12 [author] Borrow and use I2C to capture log, no log captured, further to confirm whether more consoled need.
2023-10-10 [author] I am finding the I2C and seek help from HW team, IR LE: 10.13
2023-10-09 [author] Seek support from HW team expert Defeng Tao, he is finding related support and equipment.
2023-10-05/06 ksobota: Next step is to connect I2C bus state logic analyzer to UART and inspect state of downstream bus when issue occurs. For that special BMUXP image was created to copy state of SCL and SDA to serial output, which can be monitored by logic analyzer. This in my understanding shouldn't impact reproduction rate, because of no probes connected directly to bus. It's expected we begin tests on Monday once Chinese colleagues from local HW group come back from vacation and help with a setup. Additionally, this PR is used as testing field for trying out different approaches of solving the numerous I2C issues by I2C technical forum. Thanks to high reproduction rate, there is high confidence if something works or doesn't. IR11 was created to verify if disabling all kinds of DDT and BMU register dumping could improve the outcome of this scenario. Logs were analyzed by Aleksey.
2023-10-04 [author] IR flag confirm ongoing, test result will provide LE: Oct.5th
2023-10-03 Ewa Szukała: Author shared requrements to accept - waiting for approval
2023-10-02 Ewa Szukała: The next step in this pronto is to have remote I2C state logic analyzer connected to upstream and downstream to capture what happens on the bus during an error. To create such setup , the author needs support
2023-10-01 [author] wait for new method to find the RC.
2023-09-27 [author] BMUXP is helping with this case, this looks like WA, discussion ongoing.
2023-09-25 [author] Issue reproduced twice with debug knife after revert BMUXP on OK build on 10th IR testing.
2023-09-22 ksobota: In discussion with Etienne, BMUXP 23.25.1 in OK build (posted below) is an assumed WA that made the issue go away, although there is no proof it fixes the original RC. This image contains several changes to I2C and power sequencing.
2023-09-20 [author] please see 9th IR, finally find SBTS00_ENB_9999_230726_000017 is the first OK build, and wait for developer to check which pronto may solve this issue.
2023-09-19 [author] as developer can't get the RC, they ask to test which is first build the issue get OK, it will take much effort, first I will seek help from SCM to get the package as old package didn't store on WFT.
2023-09-15 [author] discussion with ksobota, need to test and confirm what causes cell can't get onair on debug knife, SW downgrade or debug knife ? will try to downgrade to clean SBTS to confirm. the result is that cell can't get onair, log is on folder \\eseefsn50.emea.nsn-net.net\rotta4internal\LTE_2\hz_siso3\jerry\CB011005\PR721847\downgrade_from_cleanbuild_to_knife.
2023-09-13 Ewa Szukala: working on a logging improvement; CNN Candidate
2023-09-13 ksobota: IR result is back and they show that resetting bus state machine doesn't help. So SW cannot do more to try to recover from the situation at the moment. As the issue no longer reproduces with SBTS00_ENB_9999_230828_000003 I did a bisect between NOK and OK SBTS to find couple of SBTSs that I'll ask tester to verify to find what is influencing this problem. We find the ""downstream bus stuck"" problem in many PRs and they come and go, so it's important to find RC while we have high reproduction.
2023-09-12 [author] IR reply, waiting for further checking.
2023-09-11 ksobota: So from the collected serial logs during a moment when I2C starts misbehaving there is nothing abnormal reported on ABIP Marlin UART interface. On the ASIM side we're still running into problem with upstream, but I think it can be explained with results from tests conducted on Friday in Ulm's lab. A special BMUX image was prepared to intentionally break downstream bus by holding I2C SDA line down to simulate stuck condition. This in turn causes arbitration lost, busy states and invalid states seen on upstream, similar to what is seen in PR case. The difference between simulated scenario and PR scenario is that it doesn't break upstream permanently and for that we need some more testing in Ulm. My current hypothesis is that when downstream bus on ABIP breaks it breaks Xilinx bus state machine, before PCA9641 BMS is able to isolate downstream from upstream. The situation is different after site reset with clear messages about downstream stuck condition, During reboot of ASIM, state machine is also reset, which helps resolve the situation on upstream, but not on downstream. Next step: I'll prepare another debug knife which resets bus state machine after abnormal condition is detected by controller to see if it solves one of two problems seen in this PR.
2023-09-08 Ewa Szukala: IR to be replied Today
2023-09-08 ksobota: IR logs were collected, but a time frame when I2C communication drops with ABIP is missing. I asked to collect them once more, using different sequence. In the meantime, I'm brainstorming this issue with Krzysztof Adamski and I use borrowed setup in Ulm with remote I2C logic state analyzer to confirm my assumption about internal workings of Xilinx I2C bus controller. So far I did not found any abnormalities on bus physically.
2023-09-07 [author] IR reply with console log on knife testing.
2023-09-07 [author] after get help to solder R84008/R84003/R84001/R84002 red squares of ABIP, and try to capture console log, console is connected, but no log print, seek help from HW team.
2023-09-06 [author] as discussion with Dev last night, secured ABIP need to solder 0 ohms resistance between the two points in red. TT don't have this lab service, seeking help from DongXin is ongoing
2023-09-05 ksobota: I created a new debug knife and overwritten knife link in IR6. I informed [author] about it, as test was not conducted yet due to env problem. The original debug knife included in IR6 was in fact from IR4, to just collect more logs together with serial output. In this new knife, there are again major changes to transaction logic as I try to narrow down the problem on upstream bus (before site reset). To expand more on action taken between 31st and today I built several knives for local testing and confirmed that NACK bit is indeed never set in control register despite what's written in device specification, which might explain some erroneous prints seen with my knives that are in fact false positives. Along the way, I discovered some surprising decisions made in reference driver that try to work around NACK settings during receive state. My latest debug knife (included in IR6) aims to further improve handling of RX transaction with an assumption that NACKs are never set in control register (but are physically on bus lanes).
2023-09-05 [author] test environment is ready, but can't capture console log because the HW is secured, maybe it need to find none-secured ABIP to try, discussion with Dev ongoing.
2023-09-01 [author] because issue not reproduced on SBTS00_ENB_9999_230828_000003 for 100 times as required on IR.
2023-09-01 [author] please provide the guild to capture serial logs as we don't have this guild and there is no serial board. also knife can't access, waiting for ksobota to double confirm.
2023-08-31 ksobota: I raised IR to collect serial logs and try more reproduction attempts with label SBTS00_ENB_9999_230828_000003 where issue was not reported. I tried creating today and yesterday another debug knife, but I might have found some quirk in Xilinx I2C with NACK setting during read, i.e. specification might not match the behavior of controller in some cases, but this requires more testing from my side to confirm. This finding prevented debug knife creation as I couldn't enter particular transmission state outlined in specification. Tomorrow I'm OoO.
2023-08-30 ksobota: I think in this case, there might be two problems. One is with xilinx bus controller (driver or HW) that indicates upstream bus might be stuck and second (after site reset) is downstream bus stuck issue on BBMOD (HW). Reading logs, it appears that first one might lead to a second. With IR4 I get somewhat different scenario that is changing my assumptions. In IR3 we have arbitration lost situation, while in IR4 there is no such thing, however we get reports of invalid bus state, where there are mutually exclusive states read from status and control register. Where controller claims it's at the same time busy and not busy. This situation needs more time to analyze as it might indicate there is race condition somewhere in the driver (same condition in my debug knife and original vendor provided one, just interpreted differently), but also might indicate there is some problem in Xilinx bus controller itself. I'll try to create another debug knife to address the first problem and submit it along with a request to collect serial logs from ABIP LE: 31th.

2023-08-26 [Author] IR reply, issue exist with the knife
2023-08-25 [Author] will provide knife test result tomorrow as it need much time.
2023-08-25 ksobota: I sent another debug knife for reproduction, it should handle arbitration lost situation better as described in yesterday's note.
2023-08-24/25 ksobota: Analyzed IR result. In logs there is ""arbitration lost"" condition visible, which is particularly concerning as we're working with single master topologies only on backplane, so there is no other actor on the bus to acquire it. It also seems to be easily reproducible on TL. However debug knife doesn't behave as expected, due to this extreme edge case. Following this situation there is a flood of unhandled interrupts that results in IRQ being disabled and we don't get any further data. I'll modify knife to handle this edge case gracefully and re-submit IR request. In the meantime we're thinking how to perform better recovery from it, but so far it's NOT confirmed as RC of this PR. LE for new knife 25th EOB.
2023-08-24 [Author] IR reply, waiting for Ksobota further checking.

2023-08-23 ksobota: I sent IR with working debug knife. Waiting for response.
2023-08-22/23 ksobota: Issue with debug knife - it causes kernel panic in very early linux startup. Need to examine exactly why and correct it. There is difference of driver code used in marvell and generic linux repositories. I have to force aligned by manually adapting my patches which most likely introduced a regression. LE for investigation why it fails and possible correction 24th EOB.
2023-08-22 Ewa Szukala: debug knife raised - now under checking in local enviroment if it works as expected; IR should raise Today EOB
2023-08-22 [Author] still waiting for the knife
2023-08-17/18 ksobota: I started to work on a debug knife for ASIM. I'm in sync with kernel people about how to approach it best and not align custom driver fork with recent patches, but instead force ASIM to take upstream version used elsewhere. I don't expect to have debug knife this week.
2023-08-16 ksobota: I raised IR to retest with other build that had lots of changes towards i2c-xiic, but then I cancelled it, because I realized ASIM is using i2c-xiic fork that doesn't have those. So tomorrow I'll start work on incorporating those changes to debug knife. At the moment I'm puzzled by high reproduction rate (confirmed by other tester as well) and unusual I2C bus error - as to me it might point at some protocol violation because driver enters branch that basically says it did not expect some sequence of events.

2023-10-17 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: based on current analysis, whether have ARP packets or not doesn't affect the result, now we need focus on why network storm occurred on FHS and radio side, need test author to provide FHS syslog

2023-10-12 Ruying：Daily TF meeting munites
1.Based on the test results, this issue is mostly related with obasi radio, 
Next actions；
1.	OAM required more logs for further investigation,  in first priority.
2.	Disable ARP packet to collect Snapshot and system log (OK log) to compare with NOK log .
2.	need FHS log to confirm which radio introduced the network, guide provided by Chuanwang Zang  How to Collect FHS Logs - PSHZ - Dashboard (nokia.com), 
3.	query the counters of all ports
a.	Create an empty file with name ""appInhibitReboot"" in directory /configuration. (/configuration/appInhibitReboot) before reproduce issue
b.	Eth_swithch_counter -a  #query the counters of all ports

2023-10-16 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: From current test result, seems the network storm due to multiple connected FRPA, many logs have been lost, and it is suspected that the network storm caused the logs to not be collected properly. need check more FHS log to confirm, 
2023-10-13 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: request radio experts to check why network storm produced, and prepare more clear analysis file to radio, so that they can understand more about the issue. Meanwhile, IR sent to collect snapshots + FHS syslog when issue occurs to identify which raido forward the ARP packets
2023-10-12 Ruying：Daily TF set， LFS+RF+FHS+OAM experts involved to investigation this issue together，Next actions：
(1）As there are two type of RF (FRPA and FRPA ) in TL, need to clarify which RU forward the ARP packets, testing ongoing.
(2) Feedback from FRPA expert ""FRPA doesn't support VLANs, VLAN tag filtering, blocking, etc. It works in practice as an Ethernet switch. So involved FHS to check if they can do some improvement
(3)  suspect ARP packets related with configuration, as only right ABIO will sent ARP packages, but lett ASIB doesn't sent ARP packages. This point need to do more testing on TL. 

2023-10-12 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: when BTS connects only FRPA radios, ARP packets disappeared, so issue would not occurred, now check BTS connects only AHEH radios, waiting for the result.
2023-10-11 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: 
1. wait radio experts to check why radio forward ARP packets from right ABIO to left ASIB. 
2. check why right ABIO send ARP packets.
2023-10-10 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: have checked that the ARP packets are from right ABIO2 rlan0.223, now need to check why right ABIO2 rlan0.223 send this ARP packets
2023-10-09 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: waiting for RADIO experts feedback.
2023-10-06/07 ostojic:Sergiy D asked help from RADIO side to check why ARP request rate is so high;
2023-10-05 ostojic:Sergiy Dorosh making remote debug session;
2023-10-02 ostojic:Sergiy Dorosh overtake inv here;
2023-09-28 [LFS] Wait for L1 feedback in GC, PR should handover to WRO NW team to investigate during the Mid-Autumn Festival & the National Day in China from 29th Sep to 6th Oct.
2023-09-26/27 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: issue findings are the same, next step update:
1. Need L1 experts check why ABIO1 LOKIA send this 41000 packets per second traffic, the traffic kept about 35 seconds.
2. Ask tester if before have similar case and if before SW version could test passed.
3. After L1 experts check the traffic, need application experts also to check why application send 60000 packets per second traffic, the sum of send and receive packets are more than 100000 packets per seconds, and AXM CPU0 can only process max 72000 packets per second, then lead to the packets drop and network down issue.


4. the HIGH load CPU difference between SBTS and LFS due to SBTS have more network configurations, so need more CPU resource to process a network package, but this hard to be improved, all configurations are needed.

2023-09-25 [LFS] Zhu Luyang:
findings:
1. Issue can confirm that due to 41000 packets per second traffic from ABIO1 LOKIA, and then AXM need to send 60000 packets per second, CPU0 can't process so many packets in time, make the softirq reach to 100%, and at that time CPU0 can't process more packets. lead to the network down issue. 
2. On SBTS package, use ping to send traffic can also make CPU0 softirq reach to 100%, but the largest packets number can only reach to 38000 per second, so network not down.
3. On LFS package, use ping to send traffic can make only make CPU0 softirq reach to 55%, the packets number  also reach to 38000 per second, burst can reach to 50000 per second, but not cause network down issue, and at that time the softirq is 75%.
next step:
1. Check if this 7.5M/s traffic is suit specification, and whether AXM CPU0 need satisfy this traffic.
2. Check the difference between LFS and SBTS package on CPU0, check what course lead to this issue.
3.  Check if could improve the traffic process ability, such as use 2 CPUs to process the traffic.


2023-09-22 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: Have checked this issue on another TL. get the result:
1. only LFS package don't have this CPU resource full issue.
2. knife package can easily reproduce the issue due to add too many logs into sctp driver, and make it need more CPU resource.
3. test on official package still have HIGH CPU resource occupied, need check which course need so much CPU resource when issue happened.

2023.9.21 meeting minutes.
issue caused due to full CPU usage, and softirq occupied the whole CPU resource, make CPU have no resource to process the network package, then lead to timeout (use ping to send the traffic can easily reproduce the issue).
1. add ""cat /proc/softirqs"" into script to check which occupied the soft interrupt resource.
2. add ""perf top"" to check which course occupied the most CPU resource.
3. add ""sar -n DEV 1"" to check the real interface receive/send speed.
4. check this issue on another test line with newer version package.

2023-09-21 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: Check the IR11 log, then discuss the findings.

2023.9.20 meeting minutes
	1. Ask tester to check if issue could be reproduced on one ASIB  with one ABIO.
	2. Check CPU usage, and interrupt stats, can use command ""mpstat -P ALL 1"", be updated to the script
	3. Create a ticket to Intel to ask how to deal with AXM eth interface when ping have high delay during  startup .
	4. Add more ping interfaces into script, such as eths0.219, and ping ipv4 address,
        5. Check ipv4 and ipv6 memory usage, use command ""ss -4"" and ""ss -6"" .

2023-09-20 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: Check the IR10 log, then discuss the findings
2023-09-19 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: From new meeting minutes, test environment have prepared, waiting for tester reproduce the issue, IR have sent.

2023.9.18 meeting minutes
Add the following test case to the script and capture the output log when issue occurs
1. Ping test, check if ping fct to fsp and fsp to fct are normal when issue occurs.
2. dump eths0, to check if issue is only on SCTP or on all traffics
3. Print ss -S output to check if the sctp memory is normal.
4. output main traffic ports stats every seconds to check if have huge traffic when issue occurs

2023-09-18 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: After analysis the new dump file, found many packets dumped from FCT were dropped, some packets had already transferred to FSP, and be captured from the FSP dump file, but can't be seen from FCT dump file, seems the monitor interface also have packets dropped, need check more about it and discuss with teammate about the next step
2023-09-15 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: new OK and NOK logs have collected, now analysis base on it, the environment also kept, we can check it if needed. seems radio startup affect the test result ,need discuss with teammate.
2023-09-14 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: FSP still reset when issue occurred, get the new reproduce steps from tester, seems it very easy to reproduce, try to reproduce the issue by myself and check the result.
2023-09-13 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: New knife with new logs prepared, would load it to testline, and ask tester to reproduce the issue, after issue be reproduced, we would debug online.
2023-09-12 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: during debug IR8 knife, after debug finished, issue also occurred, so connect the snapshot, now analysis the snapshot and discuss with teammate of the issue.
2023-09-11 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: The newest package whether have the issue still not confirmed, ask tester to confirm, IR knife can't startup normal, ask tester to load IR7 knife, then I load the IR8 LFS knife manually.
2023-09-07/08 [LFS] Zhu Luyang: new knife provided, meanwhile request tester also test it based on the newest SW version.
2023.9.6 meeting minutes
	1. FCT logs has been overwrote, extend message log size so that can contain more LFS logs
	2. Collect port statistics when the issue occurs
	3. Based on current log, understand more about the SCTP protocol code
        4.Provide new knife with above addition logs

2023-08-04 AM: The PR is in wrong team. RF teams do not accept to get this PR of further actions.
2023-08-03 AM: if only RFP test is enough, it can be checked with tester next Monday when he come back. It is unclear who could crate a knife for testing or the change to the configuration will be ready? it is not clear who will do the change now? 
2023-07-31 MJ: Summary attached. No new findings from SoC. Need to be next checked by Quasar/AHDB.
2023-07-31 AM: Need to clarify what be the action we take to close this PR! Should the documentation for the WA be updated to be correct? There seems to be nothing that can be done from JESD HW point of view to make this go further.
2023-07-25 SPu: 
2 issues
1) Possibly unused link which shouldn't be in jesd configuration (rtbbic.json)

2) StartupNoFeedback which currently have workaround as reinitialization of RFIC and carrier reset (undocumented, AHS has pgood recovery which isn't true).
Issue 1) adds delay to this undocumented procedure and within short period 2) show up.
The issue may be within startup JESD initialization but RC is unknown and  can't guess what's wrong - why DAPD receives noFB after first carrier creation.
2023-07-21 MPe: Miika Jokinen is the key guy and on vacation
2023-07-19 MPe:It is JESD related study  what is needed. Miika Jokinen is the key guy and on vacation... No other expert to this so need to wait Miika back to business.

2023-07-12 LukaszTwardzik: [RFSW] After checking by SoC team need someone from HW team about AHDB to check that Lanes 1 and 3 (UL link id 1) used for feedback paths can be removed from rtbbic JSON, and this will get rid of the LMFC warnings and errors.. LE: EOD for find someone.

2023-12-21 MonicaZhang: Copied from Team Chat, from Sven Goenner: Marvell patch will be delayed to end of January and the previously mentioned SDK12.24.02 can not be kept. Marvell faces several issues during their implementation of the fix
2023-12-13 MonicaZhang: Copied from Team Chat, from Sven Goenner: Marvell plans to release the fix as part of CPSS4.3.13 on 07.01.2024. Most probably the new CPSS library will be part of SDK12.24.02 release, end of February. We did not get a date for the patch yet. Maybe (???) we will get one just before Christmas - let´s see and I can provide next update latest in a week
2023-12-06/07/08/11/12 MonicaZhang: From Group chat Sven Goenner feedback: Marvell was not able to provide a patch delivery date yet. Target is to provide such by next week Tuesday

 2023-11-29 : proposal from Marvell can be done but CNI need to be created. we are waiting for update on how the fixing and testing of 10 GE and 25 GE proceeds
2023-11-21/22/28After meeting : situation is more or less same as before: Marvell provided a fix on 1GE - which works perfectly and on 10GE and 25GE by end of this month (initital patch). The end of the month is at risk as they need to test many different module combinations.
2023-11-17 Next meeting with Marvell Tuesday 21.11
2023-11-08 Garstka: The fix for 1GE is in place and already incorporated. For 10 GE and 25 GE they will provide a fix by end of November, so potentially resulting in SDK12.23.12 release,
2023-10-27/30 Joanna Gebala: Marvell provided patch for 1G and developer will integrate this today to master, 10G / 25G has still issue. 
2023-10-25/26 Joanna Gębala Summary: We had a potential fix for 10G/25G delivered from Marvell in SDK23_07 but this potential fix is not behaving as expect even we have a worst behavior now. Marvell gave us a patch for 1G but the patch wasn't applicable yet- test will be 25.10. 
2023-10-20/23/24 Joanna Gębala Patch from Marwell is not working in SDK 07.
Discussion and testing ongoing 
2023-10-16/17/18 Joanna Gębala Current status: Block by SDK integration - there is some issue to integrate the latest marvel SDK. When the integration will finish, we will proceed to test the marvell provided fix New changes from Marvell will be in SDK12.23.11

2023-10-05: Jacques Brigaud: continuing to investigate, and trying to understand the issue. By analysing Serial Logs received by Elodie Decerle, it seems the issue is due to dataflashh during linux switch which generate an issue because the data fash is no more available. Continue to investigate this case.
2023-10-03 Jacques Brigaud: received many logs where the issue occurs, but the real root cause was not clearly identified. Try also to reproduce the issue locally, but without sucess. The problem would be a deadlock issue by using a semaphore, which can see only on serial link :-(

2023-08-11/14 Zou Xiaodong: two actions in 0810 TFM, LE 0814:
1 Make debug knife try to find out if we can do any optimization for the flash accessing. -- Zou Xiaodong
2 Create a script to check the lifetime data flash accessing load. -- Przemyslaw Nagay
2023-08-10 Zou Xiaodong: issue might be caused by heavy load of flash accessing, so main direction now is to check how we can reduce some load. Optimize ddal_lifetime_data.c might be able to help this situation. In order to do that, we need expert from Fault Management team to support. TFM will continue today.

2023-07-05 Sitarska: 2PRs detached and closed as CNN FNR (PR703725, PR704157), in others we're waiting for author's approval to CNN them or IR responses as some testing is still ongoing 
2023-07-04 Sitarska: 3 IRs still pending, in 4 cases the issue reproduced, in 8 cases the issue didn't reproduce
2023-07-03 Sitarska: in 4 PRs (PR707568, PR706147, PR705951, PR704019) the issue hasn't been reproduced on SBTS00, waiting for other cases, in 1 pronto (PR703598) the IR was cancelled, in 1 pronto PR713591 the issue reproduced, but the logs need to be checked by Elodie

2023-06-19 E. Decerle: no revelant trace in  the last issue reproduction. A new knife has been created and submit to PR703053 and PR703793. I can not create an IR for PR704157 as the last IR has not been responded. Discussion with HPD in progress. Snapshots from previous reproductions have been shared for analysing. It seems the symptoms are not the same between the different PR.
2023-06-19 E. Decerle : No reproduction with the debug knife which enables to confirm or not the RC of the PR. I will discuss this afternoon with HPD team to analyse HPD logs and try to understand what happened from HPD point of view. Issue has been reproduced with the knife with libmtdstor but tester didn't furnish required serial logs. I asked tester to provide them. 
2023-06-15 Ewa Szukala: results from debug knife reproduction - no reproduction catched; another attempt with debug knife will be introduced; at now  developing new, modified debug knife by Elodie;
2023-06-13 Ewa Szukala: technical discussion made - results will be developed in the new debug knife with changes; LE for the knife 14.06.2023; till now attempt with disabled WD, but using uboot_env set disable_watchdog=1 command
2023-06-12 Ewa Szukala: discussion regarding new debug knife and new addapted debug knife for PR698698
2023-06-11 Jani Kalttonen: No useful logs yet. Needs more retesting.
2023-06-10 E. Decerle : Mateusz succeeded in reproducing the issue. We saw that there was the latest debug knife on active partition and Sevada's debug knife on passive partition. (there are not the same). On the latest serial logs, unfortunately, we don't see the logs we were expecting (something like ""kernel: [  371.685627] nor_mutex_lock0=c1f32ac0,owner_task=c4a33000"") . It was asked on chat to Mateusz to reproduce the issue with the same debug knife on both partition. I've asked Amir too if he could reproduce the issue. It seems target is still not available for reproducing. Still no major progress since we failed to get the mutex owner... 
2023-06-10 Jani Kalttonen: Waiting on IR's (debug knife). Sat OT secured.
2023-06-09 Ewa Szukala: New knife has been delivered. IR have been sent to the three PR's; results from logs comaring not yet available
2023-06-07 Mtomala: Elodie is comparing  the failed log with success log. IR to be issued for 2 other testers by Elodie.
2023-06-07 Mtomala: Tester reproduced the problem on this new debug knife.Logs will be shared and checked by developer.
2023-06-07Mtomala:: aWe have currently haveone pronto awaiting reproduction with Sevada/Elodie knife and that is PR704157. Develoepr asked to share the next steps, if anything else could be done in parallel?
2023-06-06 E. Decerle: after TF meeting on friday, we concluded that lifetime-data update and hwtcli are trying to access to the bootflash at the same time. To confirm that, we need to print the owner of the mutex which blocks the hwtcli access to the booflash. A script to test the flash on the test's environment will be provided by Haitao. Test on last debug knife with backtrace for owner's mutex is being testing. Waiting for the result, before adding kernel config flag CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES (but this can prevent to reproduce the issue).  
2023-06-03/04 M.Hejmanowska: Testing with debug knife pending.No results so far.
2023-05-31 Ewa Szukala: from debug logs nothing concluded - working on the other debug knife; in pallarel watchdog knife developing
2023-05-30 Ewa Szuka?a: waiting for results from checking logg logs from reproduction; in parallel Sevada works on Aleksey idea: to disable watchdog in the test. If not reproduced, that would mean that the timer expired and we can increase it. If issue reproduces, then itâs a race condition and watchdog is not freed, thus timer will not help
2023-05-29 Ewa Szukala: issue reproduced with serial logs console - logs to check
2023-05-27/28 Jani Kalttonen: Waiting on IR (debug knife). OT secured.

2023-05-05: MZ [RFSW] In testcase Tester expects to have after link break GSM cells working. Feature 7437 the moment GSM are degraded should raise 1905 fault which would result in SM resetting the RM unit. Description provided in PR matches behavior that would true for feature 7447 - which is not yet implemented - RM recovers the BCN after link break. New pronto should be open to follow the issue with fault 1905 which is not raised correctly. Architects should analyze preconditions for which this fault shall be raised under feature 7437.. CNN candidate.

2023-09-20: Kristiina Eade: solution under discussion with HW. Impact to SW tbd
2023-09-18: TN: solution under discussion with HW. Impact to SW tbd
2023-07-07: Juha K Heikkinen: An IR has been sent to A&S to see if Specification can be set so that SysRef captiring issues can be recovered by HW recovery reset. HW recovery reset is the only way to solve the problem. We cannot screen random issues in production so they will happen from time to time. Alarms may need to be modified for that but that is an A&S issue. When the response is ready, the Pronto should be transferred to SW for resolution or otherwise, if proposd solution is rejected, Pronto should be CNN. HW solution does not exist.
2023-06-27 George:  Awaiting updates here from RF_HW_MAINTENANCE team on progress of solution.
2023-05-05 Juha K Heikkinen: The failing module has been tested several times in Oulu PME lab. So far 40 resets without issues. The module has been used in tests by SW team for some time. It seems the problem does no appear often. It is viable to think the problem is not related to programming of Clock Cleaner as it is reprogrammed after each reset. It seems the SysRef output of the clock cleaner has been permanently in Z-state until powered down. Powering down makes situation back to normal. As SW recovery reset does not help, I suggest it would be better if module initiated a unit reset (all voltages are shut down for 10 seconds) after several unsuccesfull  recovery resets. 2+1 would be my proposal. After that only the module would be considered faulty and permanent alarm would be set. We have evidence of field returns where units have been OK when they are powered up in HWS. 2nd return rate of those units show they can be just fine. We keep looking for the root cause but unfortunately it seems to take a lot of manpower and time to even get the fault on. It is difficult to test boards on table as external switching of SysRef burst is not possible. The pin is not connected.  The reason for the Pronto is related to HW, it is a hidden issue in some of the radios. They cannot be traced. The only escape is hence the implementation of unit reset to recovery procedures.
2023-04-19 I.Sularz: Broken unit was delivered to the West Link storage for packing. Later the unit will be send to Oulu. You can see progress of the process here: https://srvjira.ext.net.nokia.com/browse/LSDSUP-1638224.
2023-04-14 I.Sularz: Faulty unit will be shipped to Finland. LE:2023-04-17/18.
2023-04-13 Juha K Heikkinen: HW is needed for analysis. Root cause should be visible in logs if it is HW. We will check them but we need the HW for definitive analysis. Random can be stated when multiple units have been tested.

2023-08-15 Fan Kaihui[ST]: about the IR IR314177 , it is for Szymon Giemza not for tester.

2023-08-14 : IR314177 open to Szymon Giemza.  Propose was that to cover cases where the radio cannot communicate with the SM after the existing reboot recovery mechanism was exhausted, was to try a power cycle reset when all else fails.
A final power cycle reset would provide a last best chance for the radio to recover without requiring a truck roll.  (Yes this would erase any PM logs, but any useful PM logs can’t be recovered anyway since there is no communication with the radio.)

2023-07-27 : Confirm Not I2C or Clock Cleaner.  the data collected in this case indicates that the SerDes ATX PLLs in the FPGA did not lock, for reasons which could not be determined remotely. The clock devices, TXCO, and Clock Generator, appeared to be operating normally when the radio was remotely debugged.  The ATX PLL logic is hardcoded in the FPGA device.  Maybe with the help of SW,  a reset of the internal FPGA ATX PLL could be added, maybe this should be included when rate negotiation support of the eCPRI links is added.  

The suggestion that I was trying to propose was that to cover cases where the radio cannot communicate with the SM after the existing reboot recovery mechanism was exhausted, was to try a power cycle reset when all else fails.

A final power cycle reset would provide a last best chance for the radio to recover without requiring a truck roll.  (Yes this would erase any PM logs, but any useful PM logs can’t be recovered anyway since there is no communication with the radio.)


2023-07-26 Marcin Majewski AP: Jeff please update in the R&D Information #TF Leader name
2023-07-25  Discussion on going with RFSW and BB team on method to do deep reset on FID 10.
2023-07-19: IR310767  IR reply
18-July-2023 : IR310767  submitted.    SW should be able to recover the radio in this condition.  They will need to do a more severe reset in the case of a FID 10.  the radio knows it can see optical power on the SFP but can't establish a data connection, it should be trying to reset to recover the connection, all the way to doing a power cycle reset.  
14-Jul-2023 ; Issued a power reset command to the ADM1075, which disconnected the -48V from the radio for 10 seconds, then the radio powered on after 10 seconds and the problem was cleared. The fact that the radio was fine after the power cycle. Most likely it would be a no fault found if radio shipped here to Dallas.  SW should be able to recover the radio in this condition..
11-Jul: BB HW team is investigating if fixes (retries) have been done correctly. Trying to reproduce failure, but no replication thus far.
6-Jul: we now have an additional case added to the list of Scorpio I2C related issues: PR713090. So total list is PR697533, PR696300, PR707842, PR713090. The list is growing. We have a unit now for baseband engineer to check with scope. There were some fixes done for CPRI version which potentially did not get implemented in e-CPRI version: under investigation. Requested SW help via MS Teams chats. No affirmative response, only more requests to transfer additional SW tickets into HW bucket from FCO.
5-Jul-2023: Scorpio I2C link issues: PR696300,  PR697533, PR7078425.  Case PR697533  was closed based on CNI. FPGA code released on 25-April includes I2C retry fixes: need to see if this is available yet in radio SW load. Also, we need SW support to get CNI-103958 incorporated in that same knife along with the I2C retries. Knife with just the retries was tested by one of the labs having this issue, and it didn’t fix the issue. Something has changed in SW recently that now all these I2C problems are happening in multiple labs (PR697533, PR696300, PR707842) and multiple units.  We need help identifying ""what"" has changed and getting the I2C retries and CNI implemented. In the meantime, we are getting good support from radio baseband team to get a failing unit and measure I2C signals, but the 2 units with this problem in Dallas are being used for regression testing until 6-July. Similar to JESD issues, I2C really needs error detection and recovery implemented. Long term, this should be written into architecture requirements for every new product going forward, for all digital links in the radio. 
LE date is unknown, as we’ll need SW commitment date and lab confirmation on the fixes.
6-Jun: This pronto case is for a radio in China, NOT the 5th floor lab in Dallas (but should try on both): See also case PR697533, which was closed based on CNI. FPGA code released on 25-April includes I2C retry fixes: need to see if this is available yet in radio SW load. Also, we need CNI-103958 to be incorporated in that same knife. Request lab to try this version to see if it fixes the problem, if/when available.

2024-01-10 Przemyslaw Wydra: Status: TP is being tested on Scorpio radio. At the end of today result will be known.
Next step: When tests on Scorpio radio ends successfully then there will be next tests on other radios from rel. 6 family.
2023-01-09 Przemyslaw Wydra: Tests (UTs, SCTs) were corrected. TP will be today tested locally on hardware.
2023-01-08 Przemyslaw Wydra: Continuation of SCT correction for rel5. Simultaneously, it is being checked the solution on Scorpio HW. Next step: Finish rel5 correction LE: 2024-01-09.
2023-01-04 Przemyslaw Wydra: CT correction for rel5 continuing. Simultaneously we are checking the solution on Scorpio HW, Next step: Finish rel5 correction LE: 2024-01-09.

2024-01-02 Przemyslaw Wydra: We're fixing problems created due to rebasing the code onto new master after the break. Then we'll build the TP to test on HW. LE 04/01/24
2023-12-22 Przemyslaw Wydra: First code review ready to speed up the process,. Main task now is to prepare Test Package to test the solution on real HW for different projects. LE 05/01/24
2023-12-21 Przemyslaw Wydra: SCT and UT for CTA6 project as well as SCT for FRM6 project work on local setup. Today I'll try to merge changes to gerrite and I'll be prepaing code for the review. LE 21/12/23 EOD
2023-12-20 Przemyslaw Wydra: Investigating DapdActivation operation. Problem with it appeared after last changes so we need to take a step back.  Looks like some order of operations changed and this cause to timeout one, but little complex sct test. We analyze wisdoms that take part in the scenario. LE 21/12/23 EOD.
2023-12-19 Przemyslaw Wydra: managed to replace old CarriersObject book field. SCT reports some problems with DapdActivation operation and different configured power, we want investigate this topic today and fix UT for wisdoms that got changed. LE 20/12/23 EOD
2023-12-18 Przemyslaw Wydra: Last knife with scorpio implementation works. Now we continue to adapt  cybertron project to common changes. Today we are rewriting old cybertron wisdoms so that it works with new NormalizedCarriersState instead of old CarrierObjects book field and analyzing if all the operations are created in the right order. LE 19/12/23 EOD
2023-12-16 Jiao Jasper [Syve]: knife install failed*(failureReason: Checksum mismatch), waiting for owner  check knife
2023-12-15 Przemyslaw Wydra: TP from IR16 is failed. Logs are analyzed. At first glance the problem is with uDtx. Additionally SCTS for CTA6 and FRM6 are being corrected.
2023-12-14 Przemyslaw Wydra: TP with Draco and L1Low changes preparation to check if whole solution works after integration properly LE: 2023-12-18. SCT tests corrections are being done in the meantime.
2023-12-13 Przemyslaw Wydra: Corrections SCTs (in projects: CTA6, FRU6) in progress. Number failed tests were decreased, but still there are there.
2023-12-12 Joanna Czechowska: corrections SCTs (in projects: CTA6, FRU6) in progress LE 27.12.2023 for this step
2023-12-11 Joanna Czechowska: For that moment implementation of BEP doesn't impact on UTs in other projects (e.g. fru6, cybertron, etc), UTs are green. Unfortunately there are some problems with SCTs which impact LE to be later. Setting up the environment for the FRU6  to fix SCTs is in progress.
2023-12-06 Przemyslaw Wydra: waiting for IR results with fixes. In the meantime UT/SCTs are being corrected.
2023-12-06 Przemyslaw Wydra: Created new TP (very likely without errors). This will be tested locally. It will be submitted official via IR, when locally test ends successfully.
2023-12-05 Przemyslaw Wydra: Test with defragmentation failed, i.e. 4 new failures have appeared. Logs are being analyzed, new TP is going to be created.
2023-12-04 Przemyslaw Wydra: Logs are being analyzed. It was added new SCTs with scenario where last test failed, unfortunately those SCTs passed. There is an idea to prepare TP with corrected alarm RX Supervision but with less optimized defragmentation.
2023-11-30 Joanna Czechowska: New TP will be prepared. It will have more optimized code as well as delay to trigger alarm Rx Supervision will have default time (1sec, in IR12 it was 30 sec) LE 2023-12-01. After it, draco team will focus on SCT and UT as next steps.
2023-11-29 [Syve]Jiao jasper : test line  will be available tomorrow ，then, test the knife.
2023-11-28 Przemyslaw Wydra: TP with fix for alarm Rx Supervision is being build.
2023-11-27 Przemyslaw Wydra: Fix preparation: function ""configure uDtx"" must be called before function ""enable uDtx"". When this fix will be ready, TP will be build. LE for TP: 2023-11-29.
2023-11-23 Przemyslaw Wydra: Next step: it was noticed that alarm Rx Supervision appears even before work of BEP (defragmentation is present when, small carriers is replaced by bigger ones and no enough resources). For purpose of BEP, some operations were moved from phase crate to activate carrier. We want to prepare new TP with BEP but with operations in again during carrier creation. Looking for root cause.
2023-11-22 Przemyslaw Wydra: TP was tested (CPs were note captured). We are analyzing the logs and we are going to have discussion with architect about carrier creation and activation.
2023-11-21 Przemyslaw Wydra: TP is ready for testing. First it will be tested locally. Result of test will be logs and capture points.
2023-11-20 Przemyslaw Wydra: Developer wants to build TP, where storing Capture Points (CPs) will be enabled and time for triggering alarm Rx Supervision will be extended (we want to see how much time is needed to stabilize signal Rx).
2023-11-17 Przemyslaw Wydra: Radio Control tasks: we have to clean UT and SCT and to find root cause of RX supervision alarm. We have to move operations from phase of creation of carrier to activations of carrier - this is the reason why we have to wait more time to get proper RX signal. Detailed list of tasks will be delivered before end of 2023-11-18 to PR chat.
2023-11-14 Przemyslaw Wydra: The current state of the change (which means copying common wisdom to Scorpio) won't be accepted into the master. The developer must review the code again, use common wisdom, and fix the SCT LE  2023-12-06

2023-02-23 (GVL): Have verified that the clock jitter cleaner problem found on the FMA unit in Oulu is NOT the problem with this unit. Further troubleshooting is continuing on this unit. Will re-evaluate on Feb. 24 whether further troubleshooting in MH can be productive or whether unit should be sent to Oulu for further testing.

2023-02-16 (GVL): RCA has confirmed a HW failure on the TRX board and isolated the failure to the DFE 3 FPGA and surrounding circuitry. X-ray analysis of the board was not possible due to the size of the board exceeding the allowable size for the X-ray equipment. Next steps being determined in collaboration with US SE and mPO.

Under New Developement JIRA task (CB010523) creating new commit, Upgrading Protobuf version to 3.20.2
2023-07-31 MerjaTervaluoto: [L1low] : Continuing to fix srm7 still ongoing.

2023-05-21 RommelVasquez: [L1low] :Building TP for 5MF5 and deliver it to Przemyslaw Ficek for verification.  
Investigating the logs for ERM6 NOK status, there is Carrier power over limit issue which raises the following alarms: EFaultId_Pa_PsuPowerGood (1274), EfaultId_AnalogGainTooHigh (1314) as well as EFaultId_TxGainTooHigh (1398). 
2023-05-20 RommelVasquez: [L1low] :The CTA6 tests are passing at the moment but additional checks are needed for ST since it is in NOK status.
The ERM6 is in ongoing status LE 20.5, there are similar issues found as with the previous TP ERM6_912 as below:
- On configuration NR100 LTE20 active alarms EFaultId_Pa_PsuPowerGood (1274), EfaultId_AnalogGainTooHigh (1314) 
- Carrier power over allowed limit
- UL and DL degradation
There is analysis going on for 5MF5 logs to try and see why the TP is failing the tests. RC not known at the moment.
2023-05-19 RommelVasquez: [L1low] : Patches are delivered to all SW lines. Test Ongoing for 5MF5 & EMR6, If we get  positive test for ERM6 and 5MF5 we are going to deliver it. Planned Delivery merge 22-05-23.
2023-05-18 RommelVasquez: [L1low] :  5MF5 doesnt requires patch. 5MF5 don't have the protobuf files in the rel/aafia_master branch.Tthis branch is frozen from feature developments, therefore only maintenance changes are delivered.
2023-05-17 RommelVasquez: [L1low] : New PR received PR 2023-05-16. PR forwarded due to that L1_SW_L1LOW_THOR_ESP1 Development team is assigned for L1Low Protobuf SW version Upgrade Task https://jiradc.ext.net.nokia.com/browse/FPB-861535, Changes ready and PCI testing is Ongoing.
